This post lays out some of the highlights (in my opinion) of the talk, peppered with my understandings and some additional points that might be of interest. I will breaking this learning-post up into two parts - the first part discussing the theoretical concepts of interpretability and Part-2 on different Open Source models that are in practice today. This is Part-1.</p> <p></p> <p>The first question they started off with was probably one that was on everyone's mind - <code>Why care about Model Interpretability?</code>. The reasons they provided were threefold - - Model ethics, bias and misuse - Regulatory requirements - Trust and understanding</p> <p>Apart from the 2nd reason that most models will need to be regulated from a corporate standpoint soon, it's not hard to see why it's intuitive that models that can be understood logically internally, are easier to trust than a blackbox model that just spits out results. It's also easy to spot bias if the model's working can be understood.</p> <p>Model Interpretability can broadly be bifurcated into two categories -  <code>Global Interpretability</code> &amp; <code>Local Interpretability</code>.</p> <p>The example presented to illustrate the meaning of Global and Local interpretability was that of the purchase of multi-game tickets next year and to try and see which model would help predict this best.  <code>(1)</code> A model that would help pick out almost all the people that would purchase multi-game tickets next year.  <code>(2)</code> A model that told you what combination of characteristics of a buyer are strongly associated with multi-game purchases. <code>(3)</code> A model that told you why it thinks why a particular person would or would not purchase multi-game tickets.</p> <p>- In <code>Model (1)</code>, you get a high level of accuracy in that you get exactly what you want - the entire set of individuals that are likely to purchase a multi-game ticket and once you get this and it works, you don't really care about how this works, because it works. There is no interpretability here. - <code>Model(2)</code> is an example of one with global interpretability. This is because you're able to justify to external stakeholders why your model tells you a group of buyers will or will not buy a multi-game ticket based on the entire dataset. Examples of predictions made by this model are \"In general, people who purchased cheap seats in advance are unlikely to purchase a multi-game ticket\" or \"People who made a last-minute purchase are likely to buy a multi-game ticket.\" - <code>Model(3)</code> is indicative of local interpretability because it might tell you that a certain individual 'X' is likely to purchase a ticket with a probability of 0.82 because of contributing factors/features like seat location (38%), the fact that he purchased the ticket 3 days in advance (22%), his age (17%) and because he spent more on concessions (5%).</p> <p>Models can therefore be <code>predictive</code> or <code>explanatory</code> or both. If it's a case where you care more about immediate, accurate results than about explaining what's going on, you just want a predictive model (for e.g. Language translation). On the other hand, a medical prediction probably deserves both accuracy and explanations on how the predictions were made. More real-world usecases of where they're respectively applicable are shown in the table below -</p> <p></p> <p>In mathematical terms, let there be a set of inputs <code>X</code>, that cause a response <code>Y</code> via a function <code>F</code>, such that <code>Y=F(X)</code>. Then if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are samples from X and <code>Y</code> respectively, and <code>f</code> is a model that approximates <code>F</code>, then -  - Interpretable modeling seeks an <code>f</code> that best explains <code>F</code>  - Predictive modeling seeks an <code>f</code> that best predicts <code>y</code>.</p> <p>Ideally, we'd like to find a model <code>f</code> that explains <code>F</code> and predicts <code>y</code> but that is a practical impossibility, therefore \"tradeoffs must be made\".</p>"},{"location":"blog/2019/08/16/ml-interpretability/#oldy-but-goody-techniques-that-offer-localglobal-interpretability","title":"\"Oldy-but-goody\" Techniques that offer local/global interpretability","text":"Technique Local Global Linear Regression (prediction) :heavy_check_mark: - Fully specified model (coefficients) - :heavy_check_mark: Response Surface :heavy_check_mark: - Prediction Surface - :heavy_check_mark: Point Prediction Error Bands :heavy_check_mark: - Partial Dependency Plots - :heavy_check_mark: Variable Importance Plots (from Random Forest/XGBoost) - :heavy_check_mark: <p>I didn't quite understand their explanation wrt the first two rows.

So it follows that the first time a person (say Jackie Chiles) had a line throughout the show would be the first time he/she was featured. Other results that followed were how important a character was to the show or an episode, or in how many episodes was say, Elaine or Kramer, not present. Also, we know the central 4 characters, but how do the 3 characters apart from Jerry rank against each other? So, this is how I went about it.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2018/02/12/studying-the-show-about-nothing/#scraping-and-parsing-the-data","title":"Scraping and parsing the data.","text":"<p>I obtained the list of episodes and scraped every episode\u2019s script off of seinfeldscripts.com  using Requests at a consistent rate so as to not overwhelm them, even if it was just around 200 automated API calls. This website also has the listing of all episodes with the episode numbers from 1\u2013180 alongside it.[1] <p>The data scraped was neither very manageable nor consistent in the form obtained. So a pattern was slightly troublesome to derive, but finally I found a way to just get the dialogues and more importantly, the person who delivered them using Beautiful Soup (bs4).</p> <pre><code>soup = BeautifulSoup(req.content, \u2018html.parser\u2019)\nparagraphs = soup.find_all('p')\n\n.\n.\n.\n\nif (j.isupper() and len(j)&gt;1 and \u2018:\u2019 in j):\n     if j in chars_dict:\n         chars_dict[j]=chars_dict[j]+1\n         chars_dict[\u2018TOTAL\u2019]=chars_dict[\u2018TOTAL\u2019]+1\n     else:\n         chars_dict[j]=1\n         chars_dict[\u2018TOTAL\u2019]=chars_dict[\u2018TOTAL\u2019]+1\n</code></pre> <p>In case it was a well written script, the pattern would be something like - KRAMER: \u201cHoochiemama!\u201d</p> <p>And the above mentioned code snippet would handle. But in many of the files you had entries like - George: \u201cVandelay Industries! Say Vandelay Industries\u201d</p> <p>And the only indication here that a dialogue has begun is the colon (\u201c:\u201d).

Everyone had varied emotions on their faces - sadness, indifference, even joy? But they were probably happy about something else, surely. A funeral was not really place that induced happiness, even if it was for someone who was your mortal enemy. And Vincent liked to think he hadn't made any enemies in his lifetime; well, none that would attend his funeral anyway. It was an odd feeling, to linger around, incorporeally, within spitting distance of his own physical body. It was also funny, in a sense. When he had been alive, he had often wondered what people really thought of him. A deep sense of insecurity and cynicism had always shrouded him in social settings and he'd always questioned if any of what was happening around him was real. If the way people spoke, the things they said, if any of it was genuine. He had heard a tale as a child, of a king, who would often disguise himself and wander around his kingdom as a commoner, just to find out what his people thought of him as a person. And Vincent had been very taken with the idea. But it wasn't practical obviously. And now that he was dead, but lingering in spirit, he was doing the very thing he'd always wanted to do. Well, it wasn't the same. There was nothing he could do with whatever he learnt, but it was...something. So he leaned against the wall behind him and listened. \"He was such a friendly person, always ready to help\", a woman sniffed. Vincent inadvertently smiled. Of course he'd always helped Julia. His only regret was that he'd never asked her out like he'd wanted to. \"Really?\", Archie exclaimed, \"He was always busy whenever I asked for help!\". Hmph. Archie had been such an annoying person. Vincent had, for the longest time, out of the kindness of his heart, always picked up the phone whenever his classmate, Archie had called, even after graduation. But it seemed after a point, that Archie had always required help, maybe a little too much. And eventually, he, Vincent had stopped answering Archie's calls. He could hardly be faulted for that. He got tired. \"What about all the times I Did help you Arch?\", Vincent muttered to himself. In another corner of the room, John and James were laughing away. \"I know right!\", John guffawed, \"What was he thinking putting him on as striker?\". Vincent rolled his eyes. He wondered why they'd come. Maybe they'd just seen this as more as a way to catch up and less of a scene for paying respects. His eyes wandered around the room as he saw other familiar faces, and some unfamiliar ones. The air grew silent as the priest slowly stepped up to the pulpit and called for the eulogy. He watched his sister, Mary slowly walked up, ashen faced. She had undoubtedly been crying. Vincent watched as Mary spoke about her version of his life. How he had been the best brother ever. \"Thanks for lying, Mary\", Vincent thought. They had been close as children, but had drifted apart as adults, only ever meeting for the holidays. But still, those days Had been fun. He continued to watch as Mary finished her speech and his best friend, Tom took her place. Tom's tone was less bleak. Trust Tom to liven things up even at a funeral. He even told them about an embarassing incident that had taken place during college that they'd sworn they'd take to the grave. Well, a promise broken eh Tom?</p> <p>The ceremony ended and people were beginning to say their goodbyes. First, to Vincent's body in the casket and then to each other. As he saw them leaving, his thoughts went back to the final moments before life had left his body. He never saw the car coming till that last second when he did. His whole life had flashed before his eyes like in the movies. Or had that been the headlights of the car? Why hadn't he felt any pain? Why wasn't he given the chance to fight for his life? ....Would he have fought though? He didn't know. Now it all seemed pointless anyway.</p> <p>He sighed deeply. Is this how death was supposed to feel? ... Hollow? Then again, why should death be any different than life? He smiled to himself at the grim thought and slowly walked out of the church with his hand raised high and waving adieu to an imaginary crowd behind him. Everyone else had already left.</p>","tags":["fiction"]},{"location":"non-tech/a-z-series/b-is-for-bangalore-atozchallenge/","title":"B is for Bangalore [#AtoZChallenge]","text":"<pre><code>It was a bright summer (already?) day and I was in high spirits. And why not? I'd woken up early and on a Monday no less! Surely that was a sign of a good day? I left home to go to work at 8.45 AM as intended (but seldom carried out. Not today though. Another good sign). I got my vehicle out and was greeted by the familiar sound of the woman who comes everyday to take out the trash. This person who has no need to be on time has more sense of punctuality than the so-called skilled workers that we're dubbed to be. I greeted her in the usual fashion as I do on the days that I'm able to match her time. The ride to the Metro station was uneventful and that in itself was pleasant. I saw the usual sights - vegetable peddlers idly pedalling away on their cycles to get to their usual circuits, no doubt. Shopkeepers chatting with each other as they opened the shutters to their shops ; some early birds had begun their ritual of praying to their gods for a good day of business. Familiar, pleasant sights. I smiled to myself as I continued riding leisurely. I was on time, there was no need to rush.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>I reached the Metro station on the dot and proceeded to go to my usual platform. The train was due at 9.03 AM. I had to wait for just a little over a minute and it arrived at the scheduled time. I got in and continued reading a book from where I'd left it last night. As I immersed myself in Nonoguchi's account of the murder that had taken place, I happened to overhear two particularly loud gentlemen. My attention shifted from the book to them and their conversation, quite inadvertently. They seemed well over 50 and with relaxed expressions on their faces. One of them remarked - \"Houdu saar, ivag Bengaluru tumbaa change aag bittide\" [Oh yes sir, Bangalore (I still prefer the anglicized version of the name) has changed a lot nowadays]. I felt a faint hint of a smile cross my lips as I recalled similar conversations between my dad and his friends. I continued listening, this time with conscious attention, not with the express intent of eavesdropping, but only with curiosity to hear what He felt had particularly changed and hoped he would expound on his statement. He did. He went on to talk about how his children would no longer partake in his interests of taking early Sunday breakfast trips to Brahmin's Bar (an old hotel establishment in Gandhi Bazaar known for its tasty Idly, vada and chutney offerings), but instead woke up late and preferred to order in pizzas from \"Dominicos\". I chuckled. But I also felt slightly offended by the generalization that he offered that the entire current generation were guilty of what his children had reportedly done the previous day. He went on to rant about how \"Pensioner's paradise\", as Bangalore was once referred to, was now ridden with modern day incomplete infrastructure and how the number of parks had drastically reduced. I, with no knowledge of the past he was talking about, could only\u00a0 look on and wait for him to enlighten me (unknown to him) further. At this point however, the person he had been talking to, who had up until this point, been nodding along, finally spoke up. He mentioned the glory days too, but he also had good things to say about the importance of change and how things were not all that bleak - they were in fact travelling by a modern construction that Was the Metro. The voice on the overhead speaker had meanwhile been periodically calling out the stations the train was stopping at and it was time for me to alight at Nadaprabhu Kempegowda station (Majestic). The first gentleman I'd been listening to looked at me as he stood up from his seat, to get down and I smiled at him mentally thanking him for the conversation I had been a part of as well. He confusedly smiled back at me out of courtesy.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>As I waited for the train from Majestic to Indiranagar, I found myself thinking about the conversation and about my city. I had lived here for almost my entire life and yet I had not formed that much of a bond with it as the older generation had. No doubt, they had had more time with the city than I did, but surely, close to three decades is a long enough time? I pondered a little longer. The fact that the pace at which things had changed was probably more rapid in my time than theirs was probably a factor that contributed to the limited nostalgia. That and the innumerable other distractions - the virtual world being one of them. Then I remembered the Defence Accounts quarters I'd played in as a child, with friends I was no longer in touch with. I remembered the long walks I'd eagerly been on there to get to the library that had been torn down to make way for a gym of sorts. I even remembered the scary cycle rides through the deluge of vehicles to get to \"Sandarshini\" hotel just because I favored the sambar there over other closer hotels. I remembered the weekly trips to the Sai Baba mandir and the echoing chants of prayers that subsequently took place. I remembered the number of times I'd shown my school diary to autodrivers after school because I had not yet committed my new residential address to memory. I'd tried to pay attention to the routes they took, admittedly unsuccessfully.\n</code></pre> <pre><code>I realised I did have memories of my city after all. As the train arrived at Majestic and I got on, the glimpses of the shops and the familiar sights on the road on the way to the Metro station rose to the surface of my mind. Weren't they memories in the making as well?\u00a0 :)\n</code></pre>","tags":["past","present"]},{"location":"non-tech/a-z-series/c-is-for-chamathu-atozchallenge/","title":"C is for Chamathu* [#AtoZChallenge]","text":"<p>\"Trrrrring\", the alarm went off and he woke up groggily. \"\u00a0Uthishtothishta\u00a0Govinda Uthishta\u00a0Garuda dwaja\u00a0Uthishta\u00a0Kamalakantha trilokyam mangalam kuru\u201d , MS Subbulakshmi's voice rang through the air even as his parents were yelling at each other over what he was sure would be\u00a0trivialities like who'd let the milk boil a little too long or who forgot to put out food for the crow. He frowned. So much noise. And his day hadn't even started yet. He got out of bed and let out a sharp yelp as his right foot touched the ground. He had stepped on a pin he'd told himself he wouldn't step on when he saw it fall from the bed the previous night. He examined his foot and rubbed it where the pin had poked him. No blood. That was good. It was a Saturday, but he hadn't the leisure of a typical weekend. There was to be a function at home and a lot of guests were expected. So he had to get ready quickly and appear presentable to greet (ugh) people. Normally he would have vehemently rejected this order from his parents and gone off to Venkatraman's house to play cricket for the whole day, but this time there were bigger things at stake. No sooner had he gotten ready and dressed up when his mom called out, \"Subbuuuuu!! Poi paal vaangindu vaa da\" (Subbu, go and buy milk!). Subramani had just made up his mind to catch up on the latest cricket highlights on Star Sports before the day's chaotic scene would set in. This milk-buying very much cut into that scenario. He chose a plastic bag from the bunch of plastic bags at the end of the kitchen and walked out, muttering all the way about God and his plans to thwart his plans in life. As he got to the end of the road, he looked out of the corner of his eye for the dog that was his sworn nemesis on this road. This dog (\"Veerappan\", he had christened it), had only one mission in life. To bark at Subbu every time he crossed \"his area\" and on days that he felt not-so-lazy, chase him down the road to the corner where 3rd main ended and Murali Stores began. Today however, Veerappan seemed to be contently sleeping on the mat someone had laid out for him. \"Lucky dog. No dog functions that he has to wake up early for\", Subbu thought and continued walking past. He greeted Murali uncle, bought the milk and made his way back. Out of habit, he looked for Veerappan again. This time, the dog was missing. Subbu's heart skipped a beat. He looked around and sure enough, Veeru was standing right behind him, growling. Subbu , without a second thought ran with Veeru close behind his heels, or so he imagined. When he no longer felt chased, he looked back, only to see Veeru in the distance, sleeping, solemnly. \"WHAT. Argh.\", Subbu walked the rest of the distance wondering what had just happened. By now, there were a few vehicles already outside the gate and he warily walked in, not wanting to chit-chat with anyone right then. \"Subbuuuuuu\", a voice called out. He closed his eyes, rearranged his face into a pleasant smile and turned around to face a rotund, elderly woman, with a glint in her eye and a wide smile that was accentuated by badly applied lipstick. It was Shyamala aunty, his mom's second cousin. \"You've become so big!!!\", she exclaimed. \"Yes, well the Earth did revolve around the Sun multiple times\", he wanted to say, but he settled for just continuing to awkwardly smile and wonder if 10 seconds was sufficient time to start backing away slowly like Michael Jackson or if he was supposed to actually say something to her. He decided on the former and backed away successfully into the house and into the kitchen where he disposed of the milk packets. His first mission now complete, he thought he'd close the door to his room and relax for a few minutes before the poojai\u00a0started, when his dad called \"Subbuuu, yaar vandhurkaa paaru\" (Subbu, see who's at the door). He groaned and ambled to the door. It was Murali mama\u00a0 and Co. The fake smile again in place on his face, he greeted the family in and told them to sit on the chairs that had been neatly arranged in the hall for people who arrived to be seated on. He mentally bid the cricket highlights goodbye and waited obediently on the guests that continued to pour in. His face, ever the picture of cheeriness, Subbu flitted around the house, giving people glasses of water when they asked for it or even just looked like they wanted it, serving pongal for breakfast and later lunch. He even went along with the Poojari's\u00a0requests to go and buy bananas for the homam\u00a0offering,\u00a0braving Veerappan again. By the time it was 5 PM, Subbu was thoroughly exhausted. But the fake smile as he bid all his relatives goodbye did not fade.</p> <p>As the last of the relatives trickled out, he went inside and sat on the sofa, furiously debating if the time was right to broach the topic he had been thinking about all day. Then he made up his mind and walked up to his dad who was in the kitchen making coffee for the 5th time that day. \"Appa\", he asked gingerly, \"You said if I was chamathu today, you'd buy me that Harry Potter book no?\". Appa peered at him through his glasses. \"First you finish your exams next week. Then we will see.\"</p> <p>Subbu walked back to his room with his head hung low. He could have atleast utilized the day for studying.</p> <p>(* Chamathu means well-behaved or good/disciplined in Tamil - an expected trait repeatedly thrust by parents on unsuspecting kids)</p>","tags":["short-story","subbu"]},{"location":"non-tech/a-z-series/d-is-for-doodh-atozchallenge/","title":"D is for Doodh* [#AtoZChallenge]","text":"<p>Padma sat by the window reading \"Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix\" for what was probably the fifteenth time. She'd already binged through Goblet of Fire. When she reached the chapter \"Silver and Opals\", she looked up for the first time in three hours and out the window. The road outside was empty save for a cat that was scratching the neighbor's door on the other side. \"What if that were Minerva McGonagall?\", Padma thought to herself and chuckled, amused. She decided to give herself a break, leaned against the wall adjoining the window and closed her eyes, her mind buzzing with thoughts of Voldemort taking over Harry's dreams and wondering if she might fall victim to that too, if she fell asleep just then. She'd just closed her eyes when the doorbell rang. \"Now? Really?\", she muttered and made her way unwillingly to the front door. She peered through the peephole cautiously, but there was no one in sight. She slowly opened the door and heard a shuffling noise at her feet. It was the cat she'd seen, trying to nudge past her legs and into the house. Before she could make sense of the situation, it had already made a dash for the living room and paused at the edge of a straw mat by the poojai\u00a0room. Padma, still bewildered looked outside one last time before she closed the door and wondered who had rung the doorbell. Surely, it wasn't the cat?! She shook her head. The doorbell mystery could wait. There was a stray cat in her living room. She frowned and stared at her intruder who had by then decided that the mat was an enemy and must be destroyed. Padma meanwhile, had gathered her wits and gently started tiptoeing towards the cat; although what she would do once she approached it, she hadn't thought about just yet. The cat was still pawing away at the mat, its concentration unwavering. Padma was now within petting distance from it. Now came the almighty question. What was she going to do? What could she do? Shooing it would only drive it deeper inside her house. She couldn't just pick it up and take it outside her house.. could she? No, that was out of the question. For starters, she had no idea How to lift a cat. What if it scratched her face? No. That was out of the question. As she pondered, she slowly sat down behind the cat. Now she was level with its tail and just looking at it with a vacant expression, head tilted to a side, unable to decide what to do next. Meanwhile, the cat, who had evidently felt an alien presence around it, stiffened and looked around and with a loud and startled miaow backed a couple of steps away from Padma, who was equally startled by the feline shriek. Both looked at each other, the cat with its paws slightly lifted, ready to flee and the human with her hands behind her on the floor, a confused expression across her face. The human acted first. She raised her hands , in an expression of resignment and surrender and mouthed, \"Okay, calm down. I am not going to hurt you\", even as a voice in her head said \"You are talking...to a cat.\". Another voice in her head said \"Yeah, what if it doesn't know English?\". Padma chuckled for the second time that day having amused herself again. She shook her head again. \"This is not the time, Padma.\", she thought and began inching away from the cat. Slowly, she got up and walkedto the kitchen, all the while watching the cat through the corner of her eye. \"I might as well get you some milk\", she called out, still aware that her visitor probably didn't understand the noise that the owner of the house was making. She heated up a bowl of milk to a moderate temperature, took the bowl and placed it cautiously at the edge of the now-somewhat-worse-for-the-wear mat. The cat looked up at Padma with wide eyes and then at the bowl of milk still not moving from its position. She took the cue and backed away. This prompted it to approach the bowl and sniff its contents. Satisfied, it dipped its tongue into the milk and started lapping it up, its eyes initially on Padma and eventually on the contents of the bowl. It must have been really hungry, for it finished drinking within a matter of minutes and placed a foot on the bowl when it found that there was no more milk to drink. It looked up at a smiling Padma, who was glad that her offering had been so well accepted. \"Do you want more?\", she enquired, not really expecting a response. Those expectant eyes were answer enough and she went back to the kitchen area to heat up some more milk. This time however, the cat followed her and began poking at the slippers she had left at the entrance of the kitchen. She refilled the bowl and placed it again, this time closer to the cat that did not inch away, but was looking intently as the bowl moved from human to floor. The pace at which the bowl was emptied this time was even quicker, but it evidently sated the cat's hunger, for it did not look up again at Padma, but moved towards its favorite torn-up mat and lay down. She heated up a glass of milk, this time for herself, picked up the Harry Potter book from near the window and sat next to the cat. She took a sip of milk and opened the page to Silver and Opals and started reading out loud, a gentle palm on the cat's head - \"Where was Dumbledore, and what was he doing?...\". She paused. \"What was Dumbledore doing, Minerva?\", she addressed the cat, took another sip of milk and smiled.</p> <p>(* Doodh is the Hindi word for Milk. The idea here is to convey the ease with which bonds are formed between a human and animal with something as simple as a glass of doodh. There's no deep meaning here. It's just a day in the life of a person, that took a minor surprising turn, but ended up being a pleasant experience in the end.)</p>"},{"location":"non-tech/a-z-series/e-is-for-exam/","title":"E is for Exam [#AtoZChallenge]","text":"<p>\"Are you ready?\", the voice on the phone asked Subbu. Subbu didn't feel remotely ready. But his response didn't matter either way. It was 7.30 AM - time to leave for school. The dreaded exam week was to commence that day. He mumbled something incoherently and placed the receiver on the telephone. \"Subbuuuuu, late aachu da. Breakfast saapdu!\" [Subbuu, it's late already. Finish your breakfast!]. He wasn't hungry. In fact his stomach felt like they were full of polymers of isoprene. Why was he thinking about rubber now though? He should be mentally wading through the rivers of the world and jogging through the various farms of India. Geography had never been Subbu's strong suit and yet, that was the\u00a0 mountain he had to scale that day. He sat at the table obediently though and looked at his plate. Rice and Chapati.. Rice and wheat.. Bihar? Chattisgarh? No no.. The maximum production of rice was in West Bengal and wheat, in Uttar Pradesh. He tried to come up with mnemonics to avoid forgetting that as he poked at a chapati. His mum yelled at him again and he hastened to finish it. His mind was still buzzing with random keywords he had associated with lengthy paragraphs as he tied his shoe laces and noticed that he had worn mismatched socks. Well, it was too late to do anything about that now. He prayed that the class monitor would accept his offering of one Yummies packet and overlook this error during routine assembly checks. The school bus arrived and the driver honked rhythmically as usual. Subbu got on and waved absently to his mum. Was K2 the tallest mountain in the world or did that honor belong to Everest?\u00a0 What was Kanchenjunga then? Wait, were K2 and Kanchenjunga synonymous? Aaah! He didn't know anything! He moved to the back of the bus and squeezed in between two bulkier boys. Then he picked out a textbook with a slightly worn out cover and opened it to a page at random. Anything was worth revising. Itanagar was the capital of Arunchal Pradesh. \"Itanagar - AP, Itanagar - AP , Itanagar - AP\", he chanted in a low voice. He remembered talking about capitals with his dad the previous evening. He had asked the old man what the capital of Telengana was, confident that he wouldn't know what it was. Subbu's dad had disappointed him by not only telling him the correct answer, but supplementing it with more historical information - \"When we were studying, Andhra Pradesh was one state. Ippo daan kanna pinna nu state mela state pannindirrukange\" [\"It's only now that they're creating new states left, right and center\"]. Subbu didn't care for this new bit of information. Actually, he felt cheated that he was having to consume more nonsensical facts than his dad. He resumed memorizing the rest of the capitals of states and moved on to a chapter titled \"Weather - seasons and their importance\". Subbu groaned. In Bangalore, it was summer but it had just rained heavily the previous evening. This completely contradicted what this - he flipped to the first page - this Veena Bhargava was telling him about Karnataka's weather. She would have him believe that climate change was periodic and that there were months beyond which Summer would not last or months in which there would be no rain. He made a note to word a strong box-format letter to her after he got home. Maybe she would discard it though. He wasn't sure if adults were in the habit of receiving letters from 14 year olds. He shook his head and continued reading about how Cherrapunji had the highest amount of rainfall in the country. What was the capital of Cherrapunji again? Wait. Cherrapunji wasn't a state. He gave the page a distasteful stare and looked around at everyone else. Their peaceful expressions agitated him even further and he started flipping pages at random. He shook his head and decided he wouldn't let this faze him any further. He leaned further into the book in an act of increased focus and started reading about soils and their significance in the plantation of different types of crops, about earthquakes and tsunamis and their places of likely occurrence. Mental images of everything he had read blazed through in his mind, and at that point, he seemed unstoppable, when the bus came to a slow halt. They had reached school. He hurriedly closed his book, suddenly feeling more unprepared than ever and got down from the bus following the long file of students ahead of him. He walked into the classroom and saw huddled groups of students everywhere, no doubt trying to cram in one last satellite's name before the call for assembly. He wasn't going to try anymore though. He quietly sat at a desk closest to the door and waited with his head on the desk, trying to recall any fact he could.</p> <p>After what seemed like an eternity, he heard swift footsteps enter the door and instead of his P.E teacher's voice, he heard his class teacher call out, \"Children!\". Subbu looked up, confused. \"I have an announcement. We've just had news that a low-intensity earthquake is about to strike parts of Bangalore. The Geography exam has been postponed to tomorrow. We will be arranging for the school buses to drop you back home. \".</p> <p>\"Dei...\", Subbu thought..\"Bangalore was not listed in that chapter only no da!\".</p>","tags":["short-story","subbu"]},{"location":"non-tech/a-z-series/f-is-for-fate/","title":"F is for Fate [#AtoZChallenge]","text":"<p>Subbu walked out of the classroom having just completed his last paper of the unit-test-series. His hatred for biology was second only to his hatred for geography, which had however gone fairly smoothly, thanks to the additional day he'd got for preparation. Biology on the other hand, had not. So it was no wonder that his face was filled with dismay and apprehension as he walked to the school bus that would take him home. His friend Murali spotted him on the way despite his efforts to get away unnoticed and called out - \"Dei Subbu!! Wait da!\". Subbu tried walking faster, but Murali caught up with him and Subbu had to pretend that he was happy to see him. \"Heyy Murali, didn't see you there.\", he said. \"Hey, what value did you get for the seventh question?\", Murali asked. Subbu froze. \"Wasn't this the Biology paper?\", he asked, shocked, \"What value are you talking about?\". Murali's face broke into a grin. An unamused Subbu punched him playfully on the arm and continued walking towards the bus accompanied by Murali, who still wore a proud expression having successfully pranked his friend. Subbu couldn't be bothered to entertain anymore nonsense from anyone. He had more important things on his mind. Like how he would deal with Appa. A grim face floated lazily to the surface of Subbu's mind - \"Do well today, Subbu\", he had said. Despite the laconic tone, Subbu knew each of those words weighed a ton. He frowned. First of all, it was unfair for a Maths professor's son to be expected to do well in a subject like Biology. Isn't that what genes were all about? He had, despite his general disinterest in the subject, written a short para on whatever he could remember about genes in the test (the question was \"Describe the different types of human chromosomes [10 marks]\") and felt qualified to assess the situation objectively.</p> <p>He got onto the bus pondering the complications of life and trying to convince himself that genetics had to be the main reason for his less than awesome performance in today's paper and the fact that he had spent the whole of yesterday playing cricket with Venky couldn't have played a role. The bus weaved in and out of traffic for 30 minutes before reaching his house and he still hadn't thought of a compelling reason to give Appa for what he considered to be a dismal performance in the test. He wondered if he could stall the inevitable by perhaps interesting him in some juicy school gossip. Apparently the school sweeper, Babu had been pilfering equipment from the headmaster's office. Surely that would interest Appa? That's what adults did, right? Talk about other people? Why, just yesterday he'd heard him calling out loudly to Amma about something he'd read in the paper - some guy had robbed an elderly gentleman not far from our place. \"Did you know either of them appa?\",Subbu had asked innocently and he'd been told, as usual, to continue studying. But no doubt, the topic had piqued his interest. Yes, the Babu diversion would be the way to go.</p> <p>He stepped into the house and called out, \"Amma, Vandhutenn\" (Mum, I'm back), trying to appear confident, well aware that his knees were involuntarily shivering. \"Subbu?\", his dad called out from the sofa on the hall. \"Hi pa\",came the nonchalant reply. \"Drink your milk and get ready. We're going to Kalyanasundaram uncle's son's wedding\". That threw Subbu's entire gameplan out the window. No questions about the test?? Who was Kalyanasundaram? Nevertheless, he got ready still pondering this weird turn of events. On the way, Appa chatted animatedly about the current political situation, among other things, mostly for Amma's benefit. Subbu kept nodding knowledgeably whenever he heard a word he was familiar with. \"BJP\" and \"Congress\" were names he'd read about in his Civics text. Kalyanasundaram (KS) uncle turned out to be a tall, burly man (\"close to 7ft tall\", Subbu would later tell his friends) who greeted Appa at the entrance of the wedding hall and took them with him to get some refreshments immediately.\u00a0 They had been childhood friends and were colleagues at Appa's college. K.S and Appa were soon busy discussing the qualifications of his son and the bride and the color of their new Audi Q3. Subbu got bored and entertained himself by observing the movement of a chain of ants that had just discovered a few cubes of sugar. Just then K.S called out, \"Ah! Mr Sekaran, meet my friend Mr. Sundaram\". Subbu looked up. Something about the name seemed familiar. As he looked at the man in the horn-rimmed glasses walk up to K.S Uncle and shake his hand, Subbu's eyes widened. \"This is my son's father-in-law, Mr. Sekaran\", K.S said to Subbu's dad. Subbu was still in a state of confusion. What was his Biology teacher doing there? Meanwhile Mr. Sekaran had spotted the scrawny kid and said, \"Hey Subbu!\". Subbu groaned internally, but managed to arrange his face into an obsequious smile. \"Hello sir\", he greeted obediently. \"This boy is in my Biology class!\", he explained to Mr.K.S and Appa. Subbu had by then broken ten thousand coconuts to Lord Ganesha in his head in the hope that there would be no further exchanges between any of them about him. But Ganesha was busy in the kalyana mantapam, it appeared. \"So how was your exam today Subbu?\", Mr. Sekaran enquired. Subbu looked at Mr.Sekaran, staring daggers at him and then at Appa, who was watching intently.</p> <p>\"Sir, do you know Babu, the sweeper?\", Subbu asked hopefully.</p>","tags":["subbu"]},{"location":"non-tech/a-z-series/g-is-for-googly-atozchallenge/","title":"G is for Googly [#AtoZChallenge]","text":"<p>It had been 2 days since the wedding fiasco had happened and Subbu had had to lie through his teeth that his Bio paper had gone well. However, school was not due to start for another 10 days however and this was the reason for his renewed exuberance, having already forgotten about how guilty he had felt for lying to Appa. \"Today I am going to Venky's place and we will ride our cycles near his house for the whole day\", he announced to Amma. She surveyed him and decided there was nothing violent or idiotic about his decision, but said nothing. Empowered by the lack of protest from Amma, who normally always poured a bucket of water on his well laid plans, he continued, \"Who knows? Maybe we will stop by Venky's appa's bakery and have some veg puffs. \". Amma did not take kindly to this next plan of action and promptly said, \"Dei, do you know what oil they are using? Don't eat anything from outside.\". \"Then we will have sponge cake and salt biscuits\", he bargained, confident that neither of his new objects of desire had any oil in them. When Amma had nothing to say to this argument, he felt victorious and strutted back to his room to read a novel.</p> <p>He was soon lost in the world of wizards and witches and did not stir from his cozy armchair for close to two hours. When Harry had finally walked towards Platform 9 and 3/4 with Ron and Hermione, he closed the book and sat for a minute. Then he rushed to the hall with a brainwave. \"Amma\", he said,\" Can you buy me a diary?\". \"A diary? For what?\", she enquired. \"I want to start maintaining a record of what I do everyday. Tom Riddle also had a diary Ma.\", he said. \"You have your school diary no?\", she asked. Subbu frowned at the lack of understanding Amma was portraying. What if Tom Riddle's amma had also asked him the same question? He would have never been able to store a part of his soul in it. He gave her a cold stare and without further explanation walked away to make Appa the same request, all the while thinking if he should call himself The Heir of Iyer or The Heir of Sundaram. That would depend on whether his father agreed to buy him the diary or not. \"Appa?\", he called meekly, poking his dad on the shoulder as the latter animatedly watched an exciting match of India vs SriLanka. \"Appaaa\". Clearly Mr.Sundaram was questioning all his life decisions and regretting having a tiny dependant member in the family because it reflected in his exasperated \"Yennada?\" [What, boy?]. Subbu repeated the request he'd made of his mother, but Appa was not in a state of attentiveness, because he had immediately yelled \"Oh you idiot, how did you miss that shot!\" and drowned Subbu's request in the process.Subbu loved cricket, but at that moment he hated the 22 players on the field on that tiny 21 inch box more than anyone else in his life, maybe even more than Veerappan. He wondered for a second if he should repeat himself, but recognising the futility from the madness in Appa's eyes, he thought better of it, took his cycle and rode out the gate to Venky's house. On the way he saw Murali uncle at his shop watching a tiny TV on a shelf near the counter. \"Hi Murali uncle!\", he called as Murali uncle's gaze lifted from the TV and focused on Subbu. He had also been watching the same match Appa was. Subbu immediately gave him a disgusted look in response to the \"Hello Subbu!\" he received and pedalled away from a confused Murali.</p> <p>He knocked thrice on Venky's door, each time with increased force, before it was answered by a distracted Gopi uncle, Venky's father. Gopi uncle's torso faced Subbu, but his head was turned in the opposite direction. Subbu peered through a side to match his line of sight and closed his eyes momentarily. The same idiotic cricket match that had thwarted his one desire in life (He always referred to his current desire as his \"one desire in life\") . Subbu muttered a hurried hello, eager to get away from the vile person's presence. But he was told to sit on the sofa along with him because Venky was busy with something at the moment. \"Busy???\", Subbu wondered. He felt an immediate sense of inferiority and shame that he was not busy himself. It was all Amma and Appa's fault. If they'd got him a diary, he would have been busy as well chronicling his life in said diary while also pondering how he could save a part of his soul in it. He had also wondered if it had to be a soul that required preserving or if it could be something a little more tangible, like a nail or a strand of hair. \"So Subbu\", Gopi uncle asked,\" How were your exams?\" . \"This question again\", Subbu cursed internally. Why did the man want to make small talk? He was perfectly happy with his thoughts about objects to preserve and what kind of stunts he would try on his cycle with Venky. But he had no qualms about lying to this man who he had no obligation to, so he said \"Great uncle!\", his previous feelings of shame now washed away by a sense of pride at having impressed Gopi uncle, which was evident by the wide smile he gave him. This happiness on uncle's face may have been induced by the six that had just been scored seconds earlier on the screen, but that did not strike Subbu. \"Good, good\", he absently remarked and his gaze returned to the screen which was considerably bigger than in the Sundaram residence. Subbu\u00a0 returned to his reverie and a few more minutes passed in silence. \"Subbu!\", a voice came from behind him and he went running to it eager to escape Gopi uncle and any further incriminating questions he may have to face.</p> <p>\"Dei Venky! What kept you so busy? Do you know how much mental torture I've had to face in the interim?\", Subbu exaggerated with a pained expression on his face. Venky replied with an equally grim expression - \"Amma said I had to complete a whole chapter of Shakuntala Devi Maths problems da. Otherwise she wouldn't let me watch the cricket match today. Let's go fast, I think almost half of it is over.\"</p>","tags":["subbu"]},{"location":"non-tech/a-z-series/h-is-for-history-atozchallenge/","title":"H is for History [#AtoZChallenge]","text":"<p>\"Good morning maaaaa'm\", the class bleated obediently like a herd of sheep, Subbu among them,\u00a0as a stern looking Miss Prema entered the room with a thick book in her hand. She eyed the class suspiciously and dropped the book on the table where it landed with an\u00a0 resounding thud. The class fell silent and Prema ma'am spoke in her high pitched voice, \"This quarter, we have a lot of History to cover. So, we will not waste any time and continue where we left from before the test - \" Chapter 5: The Rise and Fall of Alexander the Great\". Subbu frowned. Why was she starting off on the first day? More importantly, had she corrected the papers yet? But he didn't dare interrupt her as she read monotonously, \"The land of Macedonia was already a great military power ...\". He instead nudged Venky, his best friend who always sat next to him in class (or rather they'd grown close as a result of being made to sit next to each) and said \"Hey, why don't you ask Prema ma'am for the marks. You did well in History no?\". Venky looked at his friend with a mixture of pride and condescension that Subbu had not only assumed his prowess in the subject, but also entrusted him with a task that he was too cowardly to do himself. \"Okay you chicken\", he commented as he cleared his throat in preparation, a little louder than he'd intended. \"Venkatraman!\", the teacher yelled, \"What is it? Why are you making sounds?\". The lion in him had shrunk into a kitten at the admonishing and he mewed incoherently. \"What is it boy? Speak up!\", she yelled again. \"Ma'am..Can you..Can I drink some water ma'am?\", he managed to squeak. He was disapprovingly given permission and had to make a show of going to the back of the class, fetching his water bottle from the array of baskets and drink it despite not being thirsty at all. Subbu looked back at his courageous friend, disappointed that the soldier had fallen without even getting a chance to yell a war-chant, let alone draw a spear. When he returned to his station sheepishly, Subbu had half a mind to taunt him, but seeing the ashen expression on his face, thought the better of it. He gave him one last look before shaking his head and looking to the other side for another chess piece to move.</p> <p>\"Muralii\", he hissed at the boy seated at the edge of the bench in the column next to his. \"Ask ma'am for test marks\", he mouthed, half voicelessly. Murali gave him a puzzled expression. He repeated his request once more before giving up hope in the method. He tore half a sheet from the last page of his neatly covered notebook , wordlessly begging Saraswati Devi forgiveness for having hurt her so and scribbled his message on it. With as much ninja skills as he could muster he casually passed the folded slip to Murali. Murali grabbed the note and read it. Then he scribbled something and passed it back clumsily to Subbu who received it with surprise. He had not expected that there would a second phase of transactions. \"Ask her yourself.\", the message read. Subbu cursed under his breath , then closed his eyes and exhaled. He raised his hand and waited patiently for Prema ma'am to pause at the end of the paragraph she was impassionately reading and look up at the class to make sure no one had slept off. Their eyes met and she called, \"Yes, what is it Subbu? Do you also want to drink water?\". The class laughed. \"Silence! \", she barked and there was. Subbu realised at that minute what Venky must have gone through and a sudden rush of sympathy for the boy washed over him. But he'd powered through the fear and asked, \"Ma'am , have you been able to maybe, correct our papers yet?\", with as much respect and doubt as he could fuel into the sentence. \"Is this what you were thinking about then? Were you not paying attention to the class? When was Alexander born?\" . Subbu was stumped. He hadn't yet received feedback about his performance in the previous test when here he was being posed with a new one! Never mind the fact that he had no idea what Alexander's birthday was! Why, he didn't even know Venky's birthday! Involuntarily, he felt ashamed that he was unaware of such an important detail about his best friend. Meanwhile Prema ma'am had decided that this silence was proof of inattentiveness (a valid accusation) and told Subbu to stand at the back of the class. Subbu was aghast. Not only had he not got an answer to his question, now he was being punished? But being the anvil, he had no choice but to meekly comply.</p> <p>He walked to the back of the class like Venky had and stood next to a blue basket, facing the board. As he stood there, his eyes flicking from\u00a0student to student and occasionally to Prema ma'am, he wondered if Alexander had ever taken orders from his teachers like this. Surely they wouldn't have conferred the title \"Great\" upon his if he had been so cowardly? Then again, being the son of a king probably came with perks like not having to listen to anyone. He stood there for what felt like a long time, day-dreaming up his own version of what Alexander's life would have been like. Eventually, the end of the class arrived and as the students grew restless, Subbu slipped out of his reverie and saw what was happening. The class monitor, Maran was distributing the answer sheets! He waited until all the sheets were distributed and waited for the teacher to call him and give him his paper. She called out, \"Subbu, because you interrupted my class, you will not be getting your paper today. Come for it tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Subbu stood at his station, dumbstruck. But after a few minutes, he comforted himself that he was probably sacrificing himself in a war for his kingdom like Alexander the Great. After all, it was because he had asked for the papers that Prema ma'am had allotted time to distribute them, he told himself. He had fought bravely, just like Alexander had, for the sake of his people and perished valiantly. Once the papers had been collected back, she said she would complete the last para that she had paused at. The class groaned but had no choice.</p> <p>He listened, despite himself as she finished -</p> <p>\"...At the young age of 32, Alexander died of chronic liver disease due to excessive drinking, thereby ending his glorious reign.\"</p>","tags":["subbu"]},{"location":"non-tech/a-z-series/i-for-ignored/","title":"I is for Ignored [#AtoZChallenge]","text":"<p>\"Whoaaaaaaa\", he yelled, a sound only he could hear. One second he saw the clear blue skies and in the very next, an expansive patch of brown mud and this pattern repeated as he rose into an arc and his ascent slowed to a halt and then he descended in the same topsy-turvy fashion with increasing velocity before crashing onto a rough surface that was immediately engulfed in darkness. He blinked. He could see nothing for what seemed like ages, but heard muffled voices in a tongue he'd come to understand in bits and pieces - some words more familiar than others. He'd learnt a lot of things over the years. He knew his name was what his handlers called \"fifty paisa\" , but he was always spoken about carelessly, it seemed, with lesser reverence than others of his kind.</p> <p>\"Heads\", he heard someone call out. And he knew his outing for the day was almost done. A brief glimmer of sunlight when one of the voices would whoop and the other would groan (he'd come to distinguish these sounds over time as well). And back into the recesses of a velcro covered, stifling enclosure he'd go with the rest of his species for company - who didn't say much but sometimes brushed against him involuntarily.\u00a0</p> <p>He closed his eyes and waited for the familiar scrape of velcros indicating his nap-time. But it never came. Instead, today, he found himself being slipped in a crevice of sorts lined with material he was unfamiliar with. He fell and waited for a landing but he kept slipping further down, grazing a surface, rolling slightly and falling through another hole of sorts for a duration only slightly lesser than the time it had taken him to down the arc moments earlier. \"Thump\", he fell face down on something hard and dusty.\u00a0He whimpered. Again, no one heard him. He waited for some agent to retrieve and return him to his familiar surroundings. No one came. He kept waiting even as dust settled on his side that faced the skies. Once in a while he felt enormous pressure on his backside, but it was always a hurried application that was immediately lifted. Initially he mistook those events to be rescue missions. But they weren't and he stayed where he was.</p> <p>After a while, he felt something he hadn't felt in a long time. He felt akin to what we would describle as ...moist. \"Patter\". \"Patter\". \"Patter\". The sound accompanying the object that caused the wetness kept hitting him and eventually he felt himself rising slowly. From his vantage point, all he could see was the surface he had been lying on but from a slight height through a medium he could not explain, but it wasn't clear. Now this surface seemed to be moving and him along with itself. He felt himself being rocked gently initially - back and forth - and then the surface began pushing him. He kept moving for a while and then fell sharply. Another thump. This time he'd fallen face-up so he could see the new gap he'd fallen from - one among a series of adjacent gaps. By now, the skies had cleared up so he could see the skies but the view was punctuated uniformly by the surface above.</p> <p>He sighed in resignation.

The latter stayed there a few more minutes watching the former struggle before sympathetically patting him on his back and walking away.\u00a0</p> <p>As he moved away from the seeker he saw Murugan, standing a few benches away, looking at Mani with a satisfied expression on his face. \u201cSee how he pitifully searches for his Parker Pen\u201d, he smirked with a whisper once Subbu was within earshot. Subbu furrowed his eyebrows - \u201cParker ..Pen?\u201d he thought, but not aloud. \u201cNow Mani has lost two items, only one of which he has noticed missing\u201d, he brooded. \u201cSubbu?\u201d, Murugan enquired, \"Do you think we should keep it for ourselves or break it?\". Subbu frowned. Of course, he had been jealous of how many more things Mani had and maybe a tiny part of him had revelled at the thought of Mani grappling with the loss of one of his prized possessions that he had \"shown off\", but was he, Subbu, an evil person? What would Harry Potter do? He pondered the paths his heroes from fiction and mythology might take if faced with such moral questions and decided with a resolve as a wave of shame washed over him - \"No\", and prepared himself to patronise Murugan for his action; but the thief had vanished out of sight and Subbu's eyes wandered back to a still worried-looking Mani. He walked back to the bemoaner and said with the tone of a savior, \"Don't worry Mani, I'll help you find your pen...err..telescope.\", he corrected himself as Mani looked at him quizzically. \"Kaleidoscope\", he was corrected. Subbu adopted a loftier expression all the while muttering to himself about having overcome jealousy and being the bigger man and yet being corrected by ungrateful monsters. As he bent under the desk himself, he wondered if he should bring up the topic of adequate compensation with his parents and ran a possible scenario over in his head about how that conversation with his father might go -</p> <p>He would gingerly broach the topic - \"Appa, Mani had brought 4 HotWheels cars today.\" Appa would remark only partially listening - \"Mm Hmm.\" He would repeat the premise for father's benefit. Appa would feign interest this time and look at him as if to wonder why this sentence was being posed to him. Then he would ask for an increase in number of cars for himself and let the chips fall where they may. He had no idea how Appa would react to this new man with a spine, but he was prepared to try, for justice's sake.</p> <p>For the second time that day, he jerked back to reality only to notice that he had wandered off to the opposite row of benches on his knees, all the while, trying to look for Mani's kaleidoscope, obviously unsuccessfully. As he prepared to abandon the search, he spotted a glint of something shiny by the trash can situated at the left end of Prema ma'am's table. He rushed to it and picked it up even as it came undone in his hand, the glass pieces smashed to smithereens. It would seem that in Mani's haste to pick up his things, this tube had fallen to the ground and scattered. He brought the remnants of the tube and the bad news back to Mani. The boy took one look at the glass pieces and started weeping profusely, spluttering pieces of speech from which Subbu gathered that Mani had had to sweep the entire house to get his Appa to buy him this what-was-once-a-fine-bangle-piece-displayer. Subbu felt even more sympathetic towards this boy and thought he should probably, at this point, not add insult to injury by enquiring if Mani had noticed anything else missing from his Bag of Wonders. By this time, two more of their classmates had arrived by Mani's side and had begun consoling him. Subbu felt confident about the moral support Mani was receiving and decided to confront Murugan immediately, chide him, maybe teach him a lesson or two about the virtues of honesty and the horridness of jealousy and get the pen back to Mani before the latter even discovered its loss - surely the poor boy had suffered enough already.</p> <p>His thoughts and actions were interrupted by Prema ma'am walking in again with an expression of what he could only surmise was absolute rage. She slammed the notebooks she was holding onto her table and dust from 1947 rose up to fill the air in the classroom, it seemed.</p> <p>\"Everyone take your bags and keep them on your desks\", she said, in an icy tone. Subbu blinked and looked around at his classmates who looked equally clueless.</p> <p>\"One of you has stolen my Parker Pen and I'm going to find out who.\"</p>","tags":["short-story","subbu"]},{"location":"non-tech/a-z-series/k-is-for-kitten/","title":"K is for Kitten","text":"<p>The person on the bike in front of me didn't move even after all the vehicles in front of him had moved and I thought, \"Oof, a stall so early in the morning.

I looked at him and followed his line of sight onto the road where there was a tiny kitten looking very agitated and confused, at everything around it. It all happened within a fraction of seconds - I braked hard and like a daisychain of hands stuck my hand to stop the vehicle on my right, but the person who stopped hadn't seen the cause yet and the car on his right moved on, in the interval of which the kitten had darted across the road right in the path of this car. I yelled inconsequentially. The car, incredibly luckily moved right over the kitten and it stood there unscathed. Two men on the bike I'd stopped yelled at me for all of 3 seconds before grasping the situation themselves. I yelled back, asking them to help me catch the kitten and release it to safety. One of them jumped to action and stopped the goods vehicle behind him and the other guy and I ran behind the kitten, our vehicles abandoned on the middle of the road. The next minute was a blur, in which the kitten had managed to find himself stuck right on top of the wheel of the goods vehicle Boy 'A' had just stopped. With Boy 'B''s help, we carefully extricated the kitten from under the vehicle and amidst its frantic, clueless struggles to get free, picked it up and dropped it off at a building by the side of the pavement.

So I took a normally forgotten turn on a commonly traveled road just to see where it led. It opened up to a pathway on one side and a lake on the other. An unfenced lake. At one point on the road, it became clear that vehicles weren't the way to travel any further. Instead there was a semi spherical wooden thing that people were seemingly supposed to get in and slide down the rest of the way. There were a bunch of these arranged alongside a wall on the left side of the road. I got into one and set myself in motion. It was very cool. I slid down the road and up when the road curved up and sideways left and right similarly. When it finally stopped, I was precariously (I'd just noticed) close to the edge of the lake. The water was sparkling under the sunlight. I forgot myself in the shimmer for a bit. Then I looked around me to see where I'd ended up and that's when I spotted the sign - \"Beware of snakes\". I immediately decided my little trip was over and set my semi sphere in motion down the nearest slope again. This time after a little while it stopped suddenly. And while I was examining the reason for my abrupt halting, my eyes fell upon a heap of a coil sitting motionless. I decided I wasn't going to wait for it to move and ran, semisphere dragging after me. In the hurried motion, the part of the semisphere I was holding broke from the whole into my hand and the rest of it rolled away into the water. But I was so panicked to understand what happened that I kept running. I ran and I ran and hoped to run up to my vehicle I think but on the way, I tripped and fell. And passed out. When I woke up, I saw a pair of beady eyes staring down at me. My vision cleared up and I realized I was face to face with either a mongoose or a badger, not knowing which because I'd never seen either in the flesh before and even the pictures I'd seen weren't very clear in the difference or I'd just not paid enough attention. The latter is more possible. It must have been the shock of the sudden sight but I passed out again. I woke up this time in the safety of my bed. I rubbed my eyes groggily and decided I must have dreamt it all. \"These dreams are getting way too realistic these days\" - I mulled.

Unfortunately, not many products are designed with these characteristics in mind. :disappointed:</p> <p>If a product is designed well, it results in \"brilliant, pleasurable products.\" And if it's not, the users are forced to behave the way the products want them to and this is counterproductive to the whole reason products are designed - to help people. </p> <p>Of late, a new brand of design is cropping up - HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN, which means exactly what you think - to be designed with a human i.e the end-user in mind. And intuitively, this is how products should have always been designed. But the problem ultimately, as even Don notes is that products are designed, largely, by engineers, who are trained to be logically thinking. But to expect the same of the users they're designing for is unfair. Sometimes blatantly so.  HCD aims at engineers focussing on what happens when things go wrong during the usage of a product and not just when things go all right.</p> <p>One of the best things that can be built into a product (where some form of a display is available) is notes on how to go about resolving the problem when it occurs.

The story traces the life, well, a few days in the life, of teenager Zack \"ZackAttack\" Lightman, who likes to play video games and beat up bullies. His father died shortly after he was born, but he left behind his legacy of video games and the same passion for games and everything \"pop culture\", in Zack. Everything changes for Zack when one day, he's picked up by a giant military flight manned by his third best friend on Earth and owner of local videogame store, Ray and tells him that he's been recruited by an international agency called the \"EDA\" to save the world from war aliens from the moon Europa. I would go on, but at this point, I feel like spending more time describing the \"plot\" of the book would be just as much time wasted as it was reading it. But here are a few things wrong with this book and they are primarily and probably due to the expectations stemming from Cline's first work - \"Ready Player One\" -  a) Too much name dropping. The number of pop-culture references are sickening and probably sufficient to cover three chapters worth of content on their own. b) Unnecessarily detailed and drawn-out explanations of certain events c) \"Plots\" drawn here and there from the likes of Deception Point and Ender's Game. d) Even things that seem like they've been written to evoke surprise fail to impress.</p> <p>If there's one thing that can be said for the book, it's that it does not glorify the protagonist.

Please don't read this if you haven't already read the book and intend to. Charlie was just a guy who wanted to fit in, you know? He just wanted to be smart \"like everyone else\" and understand what people said and..fit in. That's why he tried so hard. He jumped through every hoop Dr.Nemur and Dr. Strauss showed him and he got his wish. He became smart. He became smarter. He became the smartest person humankind ever possibly knew. Life would be so simple and happy if that was the end of the story. We love happy endings, don't we. We want the underdog to succeed. We want a triumphant person at the end of a story. Maybe that's what we get at the end; I'm not going to give anything away. But I will tell you about the process to that end. Charlie Gordon has an IQ of 68 when the story begins and life has been extremely hard for him - being abandoned by his parents, working at a bakery where he seems to have been given a chance from his perspective, but we can see they're plain bullies there, having fun at Charlie's expense and he bears it all with a grin and a laugh, because he wants to have friends. He thinks they Are his friends. And that heart of his is what makes you want to take the entire journey with him through his journal, go through everything he's gone through, through his memories of his mother - Rose, his father -Matt and his sister, Norma\u2026. The only glimmer of sunshine Charlie has or seems to have through this gloomy cloud of a fast-paced IQ-rising life of his is Alice Kinnian, one of his tutors at the facility where Charlie is to undergo treatments and eventually therapy sessions. In her, Charlie finds love and safety and I love that Daniel Keyes had her as a character. Another character that is constantly alluded to and is really, the titular character is Algernon, a mouse that Charlie is pitted against at the beginning. It's heartening to see how Charlie's relationship with Algernon changes, even if one-sided - first as a goal, then as a rival, then as a subordinate and subsequently as a pet. The symbolism of Algernon's microcosmic journey is telling and when flowers Are placed for Algernon, one can't help but feel the ground drop from under them even if they have been expecting it. At the core of it, Flowers for Algernon is, in my opinion, about relationships - the relationship with one's self, with those you count friends, those you count lovers, those you count superiors and others.

It is here that he meets his reporting officer Captain Vimes, Corporal \"Nobby\" Nobbs and Seargent Colon. They'd been quite content in their lack of a purpose for quite a while, allowing crime to thrive and all that. But Carrot's arrival has coincided with a genuine need for the Watch to well...watch.

Since then I\u2019ve read a few hundred books but they\u2019ve all been standalone novels. The only thing that comes close to a series since then was the Millenium Trilogy by Steig Larsson but that doesn\u2019t fall in this category. My reasons for not having ventured into these waters again are frankly, juvenile \u2014 chief among them and the only one worth mention being the fear that nothing will come close to the aforementioned works, which is, if the rest of the reading populace is to be believed, a blatant fallacy.</p> <p>But earlier today, after finishing yet another standalone work \u2014 \u201cBad Blood\u201d about the infamous scandal that was Theranos, I decided to start with one among the many options in fantasy fiction series available. My shortlist consisted of Malazan, The Kingkiller Chronicles, Mistborn and The Dark Tower series. When I posed this \u201cdilemma\u201d to my book club, two of my trusted friends independently and almost simultaneously suggested I start with Mistborn and the decision was made.</p> <p></p> <p>I started reading it with some residual apprehensions and was pleased to see them gradually fading away with every passing page. So far I\u2019ve finished 15% of the book and these are my thoughts along with a summary of what has happened so far \u2014</p> <p>The prologue starts off with a nobleman, Lord Tresting in the presence of an \u201cobligator\u201d, an inspector of sorts overlooking a land where the \u201cskaa\u201d he owns (his\u00a0slaves) are toiling away. Tresting comes off an obsequious worm, who wants to please the obligator and make sure everything is as desired by the latter. While scanning the land, he notices that one of the usually subservient\u00a0skaa\u00a0is looking back at him with defiance ..or so he thinks because at second glance, the offending party seems to have vanished. Tresting doesn\u2019t pay it much thought\u2026.He probably should have because it turns out that this figment of Tresting\u2019s imagination was actually a rogue flitter\u00a0skaa\u00a0named Kelsier, who\u2019s been roaming from camp to camp inciting rebellion wherever he goes (and he has a hidden agenda). While in conversation with the rest of the\u00a0skaa\u00a0his speech is interrupted with loud screams from outside the camp. This is the first time that we get a glimpse of Kelsier\u2019s \u201cpowers\u201d. He \u201cburns tin internally\u201d and is able to enhance his hearing. He understands that a young girl\u00a0skaa\u00a0is being taken advantage of by Tresting and is determined to do something about it despite the pleas of the rest of the\u00a0skaa\u00a0as it would only, they said, lead to more trouble for them. I won\u2019t divulge what happens in the remainder of the prologue to avoid spoiling any of it. Suffice to say, the chapter ends with Kelsier leaving the\u00a0skaa\u00a0and heading to the city of Luthadel.</p> <p>Chapter 1 introduces us to a girl, Vin in Luthadel, who\u2019s recently lost her only trusted companion \u2014 her brother Reen \u2014 and works for a thug named Camon and they plan to pull off a job against an obligator and his higher-ups with the help of another local thug \u2014 Theron. Vin, has a power called \u201cLuck\u201d that she can use to soothe people when they get angry and Camon, while oblivious of her power, still keeps her around because\u00a0somehow\u00a0his plans seem to work out in Vin\u2019s presence. The first meeting with an obligator seems to work out in Camon\u2019s favor but Camon ends up doublecrossing Theron and going over his head to the obligator with Vin himself for a second meeting; only, this time they cause a suspicious obligator to set a tail on them. Kelsier, meanwhile meets up with a friend of his named Dockson and tells him of his plan to assemble a crew because he wants to pull off a big job. This involves him having to rescue Vin from the clutches of her overbearing master -Camon. In hindsight, this was a trivial task for Kelsier. Where I am in the story so far is that Kelsier\u2019s rescued Vin and told her something important about her. Intrigued and wanting to learn more, Vin, apprenhensively agrees to join his team that also consists of a\u00a0Smoker, a thug who can round up other thugs and a few Mistings. Their plan is to\u2026.well, I\u2019m going to retain a bunch of spoilers for the next article, including some part of the story so far that I\u2019ve deliberately left out.</p> <p>What interested me most was the amount of pop-culture relationships I felt myself drawing as I read through the book. Kelsier\u2019s lost his wife Mare and he broods her absence as he stands on a rooftop before a job, looking at the city absently. This felt akin to Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s character in Inception who loses his wife and is left in a similar setting. Also, when Kelsier approaches Dockson and tells him he\u2019s assembling a team, it felt like a scene out of Pirates of the Caribbean : The Black Pearl when Captain Jack Sparrow approaches his friend and co-pirate Joshamee Gibbs for the same reason. Also, Jack, like Kelsier, is always of a cheerful disposition, is very respected by his crew (to an extent) and always has a plan up his sleeve. Thirdly, the mention of a 11th element that can be used to destroy the Lord Ruler felt like the mention of The One Ring and the destruction of Lord Sauron in LOTR. Anyway, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s where the similarities between Mistborn and pop-culture end, because the whole concept of Allomancy feels novel and extremely fascinating.</p> <p>This article was never finished, but the book and its sequels were completed in their reading before 2019 began, and I absolutely loved them.</p>"},{"location":"non-tech/books/nineteen-eighty-four/","title":"Nineteen Eighty-Four","text":"<p>Author : George Orwell</p> <p>This book was a roller coaster of emotions, culminating in the equivalent of a huge tidal wave crashing against a boulder, scattering into indiscernible droplets of water.

The system is one devoid of free thought and speech, the very first scene opening with scenes of hatred towards the only attempt at a revolting entity (Goldstein). Amid all this, there are still those who understand that this is not how the natural order of things should be, that they should not be rewriting history to match the present or the past predictions of Big Brother, that people should not be \u201cvaporised\u201d for committing thought crimes and the story follows one such individual\u200a\u2014\u200aWinston.

Perhaps I should have started in sequence of publication, I don't know, but no matter. The story here begins with pain. Dental pain that Hercule Poirot faces, like every man and is eyeing his fellow patients as he waits at a dentist's', with great suspicion. It is true and AC displays some brilliant observational skills of the human psyche when she relates personal pain as being projected onto the world, giving one a negative view of everyone while in that state. Shortly after being freed of said pain, Poirot is given news of the passing of his dentist, Dr. Morley and this is really where our story begins. An innocent dentist is dead; did he kill himself or was he killed? The see-saw of this question keeps shifting sides throughout the story till the very end and every co-patient of Poirot's or co-inhabitant of Dr.Morley's establishment at the time of the death is understandably a piece of the puzzle. There aren't many remarkable characters in this book, save Poirot himself. Inspector Japp (who I've not seen in any of the other books I've read) and Poirot share a something of a cross between a Sherlock-Lestrade-and-Sherlock-Watson-ish bond, chiefly because of Poirot's more amiable personality and that is nice to see. The story is fast paced for a while but towards the 60% mark, it seems to start dragging a little. I haven't felt this in the other 3 works of hers I've read. But towards the end, it accelerates again to the point of impossibility of putting the book down because \"you Just Have to Know\".</p> <p>On the whole, a pretty good mystery.

This time I do. And I intend to make full use of the privilege. There will be multiple references to \"The Lies of Locke Lamora\", hereby abbreviated TLoLL.</p> <p>I started this as soon as I was done with book #1 in the Gentleman Bastard series and that's saying something about how captivated the first book's world building left me that I didn't want to get out of it. This, the 2nd book in the series was very good as well. Did I like it as Much as I did Book 1? No. But it still stood well on its own. Feels familiar to how Well of Ascension was in comparison to The Final Empire (Mistborn #2 and #1 respectively.) If TLoLL had us following Locke Lamora and Jean Tannen solely on land, this time their time was distributed between both land and sea. The book opens to a present-scene of confrontation and double-crossing (Scott Lynch wastes no time) and then we're taken to a time when their previous story ended and this one began - aboard a ship sailing for Tal Verrar from Camorr. As in TLoLL, here as well, we have multiple timelines being narrated - a timeline of preparation for their activities and setting the stage for the \"play\" they mean to enact around unsuspecting characters and another timeline 2 years hence where the trickery is afoot. The main antagonists, so to speak, are Requin &amp; Selendri and Maxilan Stragos and Merrain. Initially all Locke and Jean wanted to do was hoodwink Requin at the Sinspire and escape, but they find themselves unwillingly at the mercy of Stragos after the latter poisons them and enlists them as his contractors, giving them the task of stirring up trouble from the seas and bringing back piracy to Tal Verrar, so that he, Stragos could defeat them using his navy and seem victorious in the eyes of the city, so as to seem in control as opposed to his current shunted standing. This puts quite the dent in Locke and Jean's plans, so they have to improvise their plans to factor this new development and Locke decides to do what he does best - pretend to be a double agent, trying to gain the favors of Requin to beat Stragos, who the Master of the Sinspire does not like either.\u00a0 Following this brief bit of initial setup on land, the duo are sent to sea to pretend Captain and First Mate of a ship called The Red Messenger, assisted and directed behind the scenes by an actual seamaster, Caldris. Unfortunately Caldris dies while they are at sea and they are found out by the crew and mutinied.\u00a0 This is the first of admittedly very few hints of convenience I felt Scott Lynch exploited as he introduced Captain Drakasha and her ship, the very people who the Archon needed as pawns for his plan, into the mix, with no real struggle on Locke and Jean's part except a few hours of sailing on a boat. Aside from that and a couple other mild issues, I felt the overall plot was well done and tied together. The finesse of TLoLL was missing as was a lot of the banter and Father Chains, Calo, Galdo and Bug were missed. There was also a gaping hole in the non-usage of an \"ally\" they picked up as they were training for their tower-jumping escapade at The Sinspire. But I'm sure that was a calculated move.</p> <p>Locke had set himself up to be the primary antihero in TLoLL. Here we see Locke a lot in the background as compared to Jean. Then again, this can be argued to be a plot feature illustrating Locke's mood and possible post-trauma effects inflicted upon him because of his losses and his wounds. To that end, the romance between Jean and Ezri Delmastro and the focus on their relationship was a pleasant introduction and read; not at all overly mushy as these scenes tend to be. What I also liked was how Scott gave the series a strong female character in Drakasha. I loved the chapters where was in focus and her way of balancing a ship as well as her role as a mother. The touch of insistence that a cat and a woman were necessary for a smooth sailing and several minute details were also very welcome.</p> <p>One thing I noticed particularly was how we see Stragos' mind at work in one of the chapters - his perspective was given importance. We've been used to seeing only the protagonists' perspectives thus far. This also set the tone for Merrain as a far more important player than she portrayed herself to be, which was evident when she escaped despite Jean and Locke's efforts and plans.\u00a0 Another thing that I loved was the consistency in the relationship between Jean and Locke; they remained thick as ...well..thieves throughout, even with that one minor argument they had that they bounced back from relatively quickly, ego suppressed and all that. Well done. And Locke's act in the final scene was lovely. Sealed the deal and all that.</p> <p>I won't tell you how the book ends for two reasons - If you've read it, you already know. And if you haven't, I'd rather you discover this bit for yourself. I can't rob you of that pleasure even if you did sign up for the spoilers.</p> <p>I'm definitely looking forward to reading The Republic of Thieves for 3 reasons - The Bondsmagi of Karthain, Sabetha's arc and to see if Locke escapes the clutches of death again.</p> <p>PS - Learnt a lot about ships and nautical terms in this book.

We get some deeper insights into what makes these characters tick in this book. The plot revolves around a rogue murderer that's going around creating all sorts of mayhem in the city, shaking its very political pillars in the process, starting with the killing of the governor's brother and it's upto Wax, Wayne and Marasi to get to the bottom of it. Brandon Sanderson's magic system itself is somewhat diminished in its use here and the book seems to revolve more around the characters' interpersonal relationships and how they grow in the process.</p> <p>Marasi learns how to be more effective in her new role as a detective (having abandoned her original career as a solicitor), traversing the different challenges her office throws at her by way of petty jealousy from her colleagues, Wax and Steris learn to be a little more comfortable with each other, even as Wax is tormented by visions of his old paramour Lessie and even Wayne is shown to have a regretful side, a face we would not expect the playful, impish character to have. There is this amazing flashback-exchange between Wax and his uncle that reveals how Wax was a \"lawman\" even as a young boy. There is no dearth of excellent dialogues that are very relevant even in our non-allomantic dull real world which suck you into the book the way only Sanderson can. The villian, revealed to be\u00a0a kandra, plays an important role as well (actually, a-duh-moment), exploiting the weaknesses of Wax and society as a whole.</p> <p>This book is.. good - the story, the familiar characters, the fights - they're all very good. I don't bemoan the time I spent reading it, because I really had fun. But it falls short of a 5-star because the original Mistborn trilogy was still So much better.

Work that is tangible, work that is an act of constant progress and work that while humble, is effective. Both, from a sense that demonstrates your growing skill in any field that you choose to show your work in, and in a sense that you have the satisfaction of having journaled work sufficiently to look back on time well spent. Now much of what I've said above are what I interpretively took away from the book. and not what was exactly said in it. And I think that is the job of the book well done. In fact, at this point in time I cannot even remember the ten tips that he's provided. I think there is one that relates to social media, one that tells you that if you show your work, people will find you, a couple of quotes and ...I don't know. More stuff. But the point is, it made me remember to work on sharing my work but more importantly, Doing the work. Work isn't meant to be done to be shared. The sharing should be a natural action that follows the doing, but the doing is not an option.

I just associated it with the word \"heist\". I didn't read the blurb at the back for some reason before I started it, but I was given to understand that it was good , so I decided to give it a shot. I went in thinking about \"Ocean's 11\", \"Now you see me\" etc. I was pleasantly surprised to discover the characters as they were being fleshed out, each more enigmatic than the last - the best of all being the main anti-hero Kaz Brekker. What a well-created character! But just as I falling in love with him, the other characters - Jasper, Inej , Nina and even Matthias and Wylan were given their backstories and it was impossible to restrict my affection to just the bastard of the Barrels. I liked that none of them were..perfect. They all had their flaws, their weaknesses and most of all, motives. Each of them had a reason for being a part of the plot. This is a good segue into the plot itself - It wasn't a straight B &amp; E and the number of obstacles in their path were to be many. The fact that Matthias and Wylan were familiar with the target destination was of assistance without making it too convenient. The minor twists towards the 60-70% mark were very welcome even though things were never boring, even till then. I loved the non-overt romantic relationship between Matthias and Nina, the description of discovery of feelings Kaz has for Inej and vice-versa and even the dynamics between Jesper and Wylan. It was a nice journey to see of a somewhat dysfunctional team coming to trust each other over the course of the mission. The introduction of the Grishaverse terminologies took some getting used to but despite not having read the other books in the universe, I was still able to understand the different specialties of each of the Grisha - the Fabrikators, the Heartrenders etc. Good magic system. All of this takes place in a city called Ketterdam and Bardugo builds place descriptions just as vividly as she builds character sketches.

I saw someone reading a book and brushing courtesy aside, poked this person and asked him what he was reading. He showed me the cover and I went \u201cAaah\u201d, not knowing what to make of it. His brief displeasure at being disturbed seemed to have vanished, because he went on to tell me that a then-popular Malayalam movie \u201cDhrishyam\u201d had been inspired by that book. I had watched the movie and its translations in other movies, so I was intrigued. But the train journey ended and so did my thoughts about the book. Then, recently there was an offer on Flipkart on a bunch of books of which this was one too. So I bought it and I\u2019m glad I did. I started reading it the very day I received it.</p> <p>The story begins with a divorced woman, Yasuko Hanaoka and her daughter, Misato just leading a normal life with an unremarkable mathematician, Tetsuya Ishigami for a neighbor. But life cannot be allowed to be led normally, as these things go and the ex-husband, Togashi starts poking around in Yasuko\u2019s life. One day he goes to her place of work to try and extort money out of her and is told to come to her house in the evening. But things get out of hand and a threatened Misato and Yasuko end up killing Togashi. Even as they\u2019re trying to figure out what to do next, Ishigami (who secretly harbors love for Yasuko) arrives at their doorstep and subtly offers to help them take care of the situation, by disposing the body and advising them on a bunch of other things that need to be done.</p> <p>Togashi\u2019s body is eventually found and a full on investigation starts with Detective Kusanagi at the helm. He is aided by a Physics professor, Dr. Manabu Yukawa. It turns out that Yukawa and Ishigami had studied at the same university and were in fact friends back in the day. What follows is a lot of probing of alibis of those involved, all of which seems iron-clad thanks to Ishigami\u2019s thorough planning. Yukawa meanwhile has his own line of investigation and collaborates a lot with his old friend, Ishigami, all the while suspecting him but also wishing that his fears go unfounded.</p> <p>The title refers to Ishigami as the Suspect X, his devotion to Yasuko, unwavering even at the last minute when he\u2019s forced to do something no one would ever do for another human being. The book, despite following a simple plot never trips at any juncture and the reader is left wanting more.</p> <p>Till the end, I felt that Ishigami, for all his brains had let his heart overpower him in his decisions but Keigo turned it around beautifully by explaining his reasoning for doing so in just a few lines. And I understood why. Till the end, I felt Yasuko was being selfish by not turning herself in and towards the end, she did. And I loved that too. It was really painful to see the brilliance of it all not working out, the calm, rational methodology not triumphant. But I guess that\u2019s how justice should work.

The story is about a young \"forger\" named Shai, who starts off being captured by the royal faction of a kingdom in the land of Sel whose ruler, Emperor Ashravan, has recently been the subject of a near-assassination. In a bid to restore the king's faculties, a deal is struck with Shai - she must forge the Emperor's soul in exchange for her freedom and her personal \"soulstamps\". The story is about the hundred days that Shai is offered to go about her task, trapped within a sealed room under the watchful eyes of Strikers and one man, Gaotona, who might be the only redeeming factor in an otherwise politically-motivated, power-hungry retinue. Will Shai succeed? Well, what really is success to her? This is best left as a journey for a reader to embark upon himself/herself.

That out of the way, I wish to share with you how I felt upon completing this book, an\u00a0epistolary, and I hope you will not mind the manner in which this review is presented. Reader, please believe me when I say this book found me rather than my seeking it. A dear friend first sent me a link to the trailer for the Netflix movie version late last year and at the time, I remember being charmed by the trailer, although , it quickly slipped my mind. Early this year, someone at my book club meeting mentioned in passing that they\u2019d watched the movie and that it was actually derived from a book and I remember feeling surprised but again, I paid it no further heed and got on with my life. It was only two weeks ago when I was listening to a podcast that one of the speakers spoke about how she\u2019d stopped referring to her Book Club as such and now referred to it as a \u201cLiterary Society\u201d after being influenced and enamoured by the book. By now I was very intrigued and on my very next visit to Blossoms, a lovely bookstore here in Bangalore where I reside, I picked up \"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\u201d and began reading it the very same day.</p> <p>And I was hooked.\u00a0</p> <p>My dear reader, I tore through the book as though gripped by a monster who craves nothing else but devour page after page of content. At first, Juliet Ashton, who\u2019s something of a protagonist, I will not lie, struck me as something of a bland character, someone who needed crutches upon which to stand; Sidney Stark and his sister Sophie Strachan being the crutches. Her story begins with her bemoaning the lack of a subject about which to write a book. And as fate would have it, a letter drops onto her lap, sent to her by one Mr. Dawsey Adams of Guernsey, an island in the English Channels. He seeks nothing but to thank the previous owner of a book he possesses - Essays of Elia - and to know more about the author of the book, Charles Lamb. It is in this letter that he also mentions the existence of the literary club that he\u2019s a \u00a0founding member of, on Guernsey. An intrigued Juliet writes back to him and informs him of an avenue where he can obtain a copy of the biography of Charles Lamb and this is where the tale picks up steam.</p> <p>In the meantime, Juliet is also the recipient of a large and incessant amount of flowers from what is revealed to be a wealthy American publisher and an eventual courter of Juliet,\u00a0Markham V. Reynolds, Jr. What follows is story of collaboration of Juliet with a host of Guernsey inhabitants and members of the Literary Society which seems more tightly knit than that can be said for blood-related families today. And in them, Juliet found more than just a topic for a book. She found friends, some who eventually became family, I suppose. I loved most of the characters , Reader - the supportive Sophie, the feisty Isola, the quiet Dawsey, the capricious Sidney , the troubled Remy and most of all, the invisible yet amazing\u00a0Elizabeth. Elizabeth was the founder of the Society, dear Reader and she, while never featured in the book as a character with a voice was one of the strongest characters written in a story. The reason I say this is because she\u2019s shown to have had a personality of selflessness. When she quick-wittedly thought of announcing to a German soldier that her group that was outdoors after curfew was in fact a literary society, when she got romantically involved with Christian Hellman, in spite of his German alliance, recognising him for the good man he was, when she slapped Adelaide Addison for being horrid to the children at Guernsey , and when she, with no concern for her own life, stood up for a fellow woman being tortured at the concentration camp she was held captive at. I love the authors for being so brilliant in creating this strong character.I found myself thinking about the unfairness meted to her and I remember my jaw clenching when I realised that she never had the life she deserved. But then I remembered she was simply a character in a book. I smiled to myself at the realisation of the effect the authors had had on me.</p> <p>Well done.</p> <p>Over time, and with the passing of the story it seemed to me that I might have judged Juliet Ashton\u2019s character prematurely and somewhat harshly, for she matured. She learnt to have a spine of her own and recognised Mark Reynolds for the bully he was and sent him packing on his way when he proposed marriage to her. She came to be a voice for the people of Guernsey and a provider of more than just communication from London and the world outside Guernsey. She adopted Kit, Elizabeth\u2019s daughter and this is one of the things that ingratiated me most to her. And she, like Elizabeth didn\u2019t hesitate once she was sure of the man she wished to marry and spend her life with, and seeked him out.\u00a0</p> <p>Is there anything I didn\u2019t like about the book? Well, Sidney\u2019s character seemed a little off-putting at times and Mark was absolutely despicable. But I suppose they were integral to the whole thing, so I shall harp upon them no further.\u00a0</p> <p>All in all, I say it again, Reader. I loved this book. It made me feel ..warm. I felt like I was travelling with Juliet every step of the way and I guess that\u2019s how Mary Ann Shaffer and her niece, Annie Barrows intended it. And I urge you to read it as well. \ud83d\ude42 \u00a0</p> <p>Yours, Abhiram</p> <p>Subjective Rating: 5.0/5.0.</p>"},{"location":"non-tech/books/the-lies-of-locke-lamora/","title":"The Lies of Locke Lamora","text":"<p>Author : Scott Lynch</p> <p></p> <p>I find myself shaking my head in amazement, shuddering as I write this. This was one hell of a journey. I started this having finished a few Sanderson books and my head was full of magic systems and I somehow led myself to believe that this book was along those same lines. But as I started reading and finding no hints of any visible sorcery (atleast in the first half), I thought I would be disappointed, but the disappointment never came. I just felt more and more sucked in with each passing page. Right from the get-go in fact, when \"Father\" Chains is introduced to the would-be Thorn of Camorr, the grasp of a promised-roller coaster held on tight and never let go. Locke's weaving in and out of disguises as Lucas Fehrwright, a Midnighter and everything in between, and his camaraderie with the Gentleman Bastards - Calo, Galdo, Bug and Jean was everything I could have wanted in a book if not more. All the minor and \"boss\" antagonists (Conte, the Capas )are given a believable amount of power and matched well against the protagonists which is more than I can say for many other books which leave you feeling a sense of disbelief at the protagonist's sudden victory or his/her unfair ease. Scott Lynch's writing style of alternating between the present-day-plot and the trainings-in-the-past make for an interesting experience as well. Over the chapters you come to recognise that what he talks about as an episode or a learning in the past will be relevant almost immediately in the chapters to come as an instrument in the present. The language is very rich as well. At many times I found myself marvelling over the exquisite (yet not overly grandiose) construction of sentences. The story is compelling on its own merit as well, even without the rich characters and detailed world building (Shades Hill, Perelando etc) . We start off with the fleshing of characters, followed by a well crafted masterplan of theft, all of which pale smoothly when you realise what the story is really about - Revenge.\u00a0</p> <p>I loved it.  </p> <p>Favorite quotes -(Reveal) Such was the custom with every note that was sealed in blue with nothing but the stylized sigin of a spider for its credentials. : Chapter 9  </p> <p>(Revenge) \u201cWhen you see the Crooked Warden,\" said Locke, twisting something in his hands, \"tell him that Locke Lamora learns slowly, but he learns well.

They try to get physiker after physiker to examine and possibly provide Locke an antidote for the poison the Archon left them with, but with consistent failure. When all hope seems lost, they're approached by the one person they'd hoped they'd washed their hands off of - a Bondsmage. Patience, as she called herself, proposed a deal with the last remaining Gentlemen Bastards; an election fixture at Karthain in exchange for Locke's revival to health. With no real options, they begrudgingly find themselves accepting the deal with no real idea of what they were getting themselves into. In all honesty, I Knew they couldn't Kill off the most interesting protagonist throughout the series with a mere poison, so the introduction of the antidote in this manner was interesting. What Was a let-down though was the manner in which a reunion with their long-lost lady Gentleman Bastard, Sabetha was conducted. She was their rival-to-be in the contest that was the winning of the Election. But this was a minor convenience in the grand scheme of things, so I bemoan it very little. I was left wanting in the previous book, to know more about Sabetha and that was definitely slaked here. Her character despite having received only 33% attention as far as the entire universe (so far) is concerned, has been very fleshed out in this book.\u00a0 Anyway, the rest of the story is a chain of tricks, alternatingly pulled in turn by Locke (aided ably by Jean) and Sabetha, to try and benefit the respective parties they're trying to help win - Deep Roots and Black Iris respectively. The tricks are crafted skilfully by Scott Lynch, in various degrees of complexity - some are elaborate and some are childishly simple, but they never ceased to amaze me, the reader.\u00a0 Another thing I loved about the book and something Scott has maintained throughout the trilogy is the seamless shifts between stories of the past and the present. The former is a journey of the Bastards into a theatrical production of a play titled \"The Republic of Thieves\", which is, if you're paying attention, the title of the book. The play itself, with Aurin, Ferrin and Amadin felt like the foreshadowing of the whole plot, a story within the story, if you will. The latter brings into focus the rivalry between Locke and Sabetha, even as they grapple with their feelings for one other.\u00a0 And much like how we humans sometimes feel like we're puppets strung along by invisible forces in this vast drama that is life, Locke, Jean, Sabetha, the parties and the people of Karthain are very much controlled by the all-seeing Bondsmagi of Karthain , primarily ruled by 4 main Archmagi - Archedama Patience, Archedon Providence, Archedama Foresight and Archedon Temperance - and these figureheads have an arc and schemes of their own which we're slowly led through, the reasons divulged towards the end.\u00a0 There are a lot of minor characters introduced in this book, but they serve their purpose as pawns in schemes and they serve it well - nothing more, nothing less. The presence of the Sanza twins, even as characters in flashbacks, was regaling. The Thorn of Camorr and his Bastard brothers have provided me with a lot of joy and I've savored every bit of the story thus far. I look forward to some questions in my mind being answered with the next and possibly final instalment in the series - \"The Thorn of Emberlain\".</p> <p>PS - Look out for the metaphors.

And this should be review enough to serve as a recommendation for anyone else considering to pick this up as their next read, but there's so much more I have to say about it. When you think about a book, there are a lot of factors to consider - the plot, the characters, the locations, interpersonal relationships, facts, consistencies etc. The strongest factor in this debut book by Alex Michaelides is definitely Time (or timelines, if you prefer). The narrative alternates between the voices of Alicia Berenson (the titular character) and Theo Faber (the psychotherapist, who is determined to make her talk), but the shift is always seamless, and that I believe is an excellent trait in storytelling. Their timelines are the past and the present respectively. The former goes about narrating her, Alicia's life with Gabriel (her husband) and their relationship, their stories that circle around Max (Gabriel's brother), Paul (Alicia's brother) and a couple of other recurring characters. While she is battling a lot of antagonistic external elements in her life, there are some inner demons as well that she constantly is forced to face. The latter revolves around Theo's own journey into his profession and his life post joining The Grove, a life he's decided to begin with the sole purpose of \"rescuing\" Alicia, all the while coming to terms with his own challenges at home. What follows is a tale of following-the-breadcrumbs, as Theo undertakes a investigative trip down Alicia's memory lane and goes about meeting all her former associations to understand her life and to attempt to help her break her silence. I will not tell you if he succeeds or fails. But I will tell you that this book is more than a set of psychotherapist-patient interviews, not that you ever thought it was. Jokes apart, it's a thoroughly well written book that destigmatizes therapy a lot, and also makes you introspect, delve into your own psyche...question your voids and wonder if you are as whole as you thought you were or if you're really at peace with yourself, make you feel lucky for having a wholesome childhood, because, as Alex believes, that's where it all begins -</p> <p>\"As babies, we are innocent sponges, blank slates, with only the most basic needs present: to eat, shit, love, and be loved. But something goes wrong, depending on the circumstances into which we are born, and the house in which we grow up.

But day before yesterday, I hit the 40% mark and that's where I was hooked. Nana is a stray cat who's fiercely independent and doesn't care for humans; He even only begrudgingly and helplessly accepts the care of the human who nurses him back to health when he's hit by a car. Once he's healed, he stays with him out of sheer \"eyeroll-y\" gratitude but then eventually warms up to him. The cat's travelling chronicles begin when Satoru, after 5 years of living with Nana, has come to the decision of finding him a new home for reasons that are divulged way later in the book. And at every stop that they make, Nana finds a way to create problems just enough that Satoru has to accept failure in making that place Nana's next residence and the journey goes on. Hiro Arikawa does not shy away from wilfully taking time to describe the sights along the journey, the flowers, the Pampas, Mount Fuji and other beautiful scenes that they pass through. He also fleshes out the few but memorable characters that Satoru interacts with , so much so that you cannot forget them and the relationships they share with Satoru as friends or as a family member or even a former pet. I'm blown away by the consistency with which he's put himself in the paws of a cat throughout with zero slips and as a reader, so are you. And then there is the moment where there is the equivalent of a series of plates crashing where you don't see it coming or rather, I didn't see it coming and before I knew it, I was sobbing like a little baby.

That's what this book uses as tools in an articulate game of War. The central characters are Siri, Vivenna, Susebron, Vasher, Nightblood, LightSong and Denth. None of these names mean anything to you if you haven't read the book yet. Anyway, the book starts off with the attempt of a treaty fulfilment between Idris and Hallandren, the two cities at the center of this story, the former a minor kingdom desiring to appease the latter. To this end, a princess is to be sent from Idris to Hallandren so a royal heir can be obtained to take over and continue the current God King's rule. But the king of Idris sends the youngest of his daughters Siri as opposed to the eldest, Vivenna who should have rightfully been sent. This in itself wouldn't have been a problem, but the political unrest that is already present in Hallandren as a result of resident Idrian rebels is what kickstarts the rest of the drama that unfolds.\u00a0 And that's what this really is at the end of the day - a political drama with a magic system that has two feet to stand on its own but when I compare it to Mistborn, the system that revolves around Breath and \"Awakening\" really didn't appeal to me all that much. It was a good story, with its highs and lows and suspense-points, but I didn't have the same kind of high at the end as I did when I finished The Hero of Ages. What I did enjoy however was the plentiful banter between sets of characters - Lightsong and Blushweaver, Denth and Tonk Fah, Nightsong and Vasher (such as it was). I loved the way he grew the relationship between Siri and Susebron from one of one-sided fear to the stable relationship it culminated in (not a spoiler). And I will say this for Sanderson - he does not leave many loose ends. I'd have liked to know if Fafen ever did anything of consequence , for example. But that is still an itch that is solely in my mind and has no bearing as far as the story is concerned which tied together well enough.\u00a0 All in all, a good read.\u00a0</p> <p>Subjective Rating : 4.0 / 5.0</p>","tags":["bookreviews"]},{"location":"non-tech/mainstream/","title":"Mainstream","text":"<p>The crack on the pavement had begun yawning at some point and had never closed its mouth. Unfortunately, Ramana was too lost in his thoughts to notice it and his right leg sank into it, tripping him enough to lose his balance and fall onto the surface, which he had the presence of mind to try and break with his hands. Unfortunately, one of these hands held a milk packet and the other clutched a newspaper roll of the day (14 Feb 1994), both of which he had just procured, and the result was two scraped palms, a mildly twisted foot, a very wet newspaper and one lost milk packet. \"Great\", he muttered once he'd picked himself back up and examined the damage, \"Just great.\". Perhaps, at this point, I should tell you a little about Ramana. He was 23 years old, a college-dropout at the age of 19 and a filler of job applications for a 3-year period, a pursuit at which he was yet to be successful. It was around the last qualification that he had been deep in thought about when he'd stuck his foot into the pavement crack. His father, Dr. Sapthagiri, [\"M.D\", he'd made a point of announcing everytime he introduced himself] was not so quietly disappointed with the credentials of his non-Dr., non-MD son and made no attempts at hiding said disappointment everytime Ramana was within earshot. \"40000 Rubees per annum!\", the good doctor had called out to Ramana's mother, Lakshmi, that very morning. It seemed as if within the last few days, all of Sapthagiri's friends' sons and daughters had started their respective employments with salaries greater than Ramana's current income of 0 INR. After the 5th day of hearing numbers in the morning in lieu of a \"Good morning\", he started suspecting that his father was just inventing friends and their children at this point. Dr. Lakshmi (Ph.D) would merely sigh at her husband's not-so-subtle mocking and cast a look of pity mixed with concern in the direction of Ramana's room. It's not as if the boy wasn't trying. He just hadn't had the good fortune of being one of those offsprings that got the best genes of both parents. Here it seemed as if he'd gotten neither. But he Was still trying.</p> <p>Ramana had left the house to carry out his daily routine of bringing the day's newspaper and a packet of milk, the number his father had called out still ringing in his ears and the train of thoughts that stemmed from his here had culminated in his crashing onto the pavement, milk and all. He'd just about dusted himself off and was searching for a hotel or something he could wash his hands at, when the propreitor of the store near where he'd fallen came rushing out - \"Ayyoo, I keep telling these Municipality fellows to do something about this pavement, but do they listen! Never! Vaa vaa, come inside and clean yourself up\", he beckoned Ramana inside his shop and led him to a small sink at the back. Once he'd washed himself off and disposed of the wet milk packet and the useless newspaper roll, his eyes lingered on the rest of the store that was filled with pictures of locations that were decidedly not where they were. The store owner was a photographer, he decided, and asked incredulously- \"So, you've been to alllll these places?\". The owner laughed and said - \"No no, I'm a travel agent, the first one in the town! We've opened only a few months ago!\", he said proudly. Ramana had to take his word for it. It was the first time in his life that he was hearing about this sort of a profession. \"So, what does a travel agent do? You've already denied travelling to these places\", he asked wisely. The owner, Satish, explained that he had contractors in all the places in the pictures and that they served as guides. The guides took people in the town to different places, showed them around and brought them back to the town. How many people and how many places so far, Ramana had wondered and Satish had admitted that they had only taken 2 people so far to another town 50 kms from there, but it was a start. Some of the photos had been sent to him by rich relatives by post, but that is where they wanted to go eventually, he had confided in the boy, once he'd decided that Ramana was not a prospective customer and just a curious fellow albeit a somewhat dim one from the looks of it. He did not voice this last bit of opinion. Ramana, after a few more smart sounding dialogues left Satish's shop, thankful and filled with admiration. Here was a chap, creating an occupation out of nothing and he on the other hand had spent the last 3 years merely applying to mainstream occupations - many typing establishments (even though his typing speed was yet to be determined), some banks and one post office.</p> <p>As he walked back, he thought about the last thing Satish had told him in response to what he had asked. \"I started this because I wanted to travel the world but I had no money, so I thought I'd atleast try to make other people travel the world and give me money to help them do it.\". Ramana thought about what he wanted most in the world. \"I want a job\", he said loudly and a resting dog stood up suddenly. By the time he reached home, he'd made up his mind. He would start a job agency for people searching for jobs. He had filled up so many forms, surely there was some merit to that, wasn't there? What if he couldn't get a job himself? He would help others and that would be his job. He didn't know everything that it would take to start such an establishment, but he'd figure it out. He'd show his father that he too could make thousands of rubees. Hmph.</p> <p>He walked in the door, a new man. Determined.</p> <p>He washed his legs and prepared to go to his room to write up the initial plan to set up a job agency when his father's voice rang out - \"Where is the paper da Ramana?\"</p>"},{"location":"non-tech/mainstream/2019-07-08-Podcasts-I-Like/","title":"Podcasts I like","text":"My current regulars <ul> <li>  Mythology by Parcast </li> <li>  Rationally speaking with Julia Galef </li> <li> The Tim Ferriss Show </li> <li> Naval Ravikant </li> <li> Data Stories </li> <li> On Being with Krista Tippett</li> <li> The Python Podcast.__init </li> <li> Akimbo: A Podcast from Seth Godin </li> <li> Outliers</li> <li> Fall of Civilizations</li> </ul> My favorite episodes Literary <ul> <li>Is the catholic church a force for good - An Intelligence Squared Debate - With Stephen Fry and Christopher Hitchens</li> <li>What makes us human? - with Stephen Fry </li> <li>The Four Horsemen - Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennet, Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris </li> <li>The Tim Ferriss Show - with Neil Gaiman</li> <li>Neil Gaiman: How Stories Last</li> <li>Stephen Fry on PG Wodehouse</li> </ul> Economics, Psychology, Marketing <ul> <li>The Psychology of Advertising with Rory Sutherland</li> <li>Dan Ariely | Payoff </li> <li>Rationally Speaking #178 - Tim Urban on \"Trying to live </li> </ul> On Data <ul> <li>Data Stories : Color with Karen Schloss</li> <li>FlowingData with Nathan Yau </li> </ul> Python Podcasts <ul> <li>The Real Python Podcast</li> <li>Talk Python To Me </li> <li>Python Bytes </li> <li>Test and Code </li> <li>From Python Import Podcast </li> <li>podcast.init </li> </ul> Podcasts by Friends <ul> <li>Tales of Time Travel by Gautham Shenoy</li> <li>Kannada Science Fiction by Gautham Shenoy</li> <li>The Forgotten Heritage of the Deccan by Karthik Malli</li> </ul> People's Choice <ul> <li>  Simblified </li> <li>  The Pragati Podcast </li> <li> Paperback </li> <li> The Seen and the Unseen </li> <li> Echoes of India </li> </ul> <p>Via Nishant Singh</p> <p>-  The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish  -  99% Invisible </p> <p>Via Deepak V</p> <ul> <li> Hidden Brain </li> <li> The Moth </li> <li> The Infinite Monkey Cage </li> <li> Quirks and Quarks  </li> <li> The Curious Cases of Rutherford &amp; Fry </li> <li> The Intersection </li> </ul> <p>Via karmanya</p> <ul> <li> Freakonomics Radio</li> <li> Reply All</li> </ul> <p>Via Chaitanya</p> <ul> <li> Invisibilia</li> </ul> <p>Via Preeti</p> <ul> <li> Lore</li> </ul> <p>Via Kriti Monga</p> <ul> <li> Clever - Amy Devers + Jaime Derringer / Design Milk</li> <li> 5x15</li> <li> Design Matters with Debbie Millman</li> <li> Stuff You Should Know </li> </ul> <p>If you'd like to suggest your own favorites to be added to this list, leave them in the comments!</p> Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. <p>{% endif %}</p>"},{"location":"non-tech/mini-essays/","title":"Index","text":"<ul> <li>I Just Want to Write on the Internet, What Should I Use?</li> <li>July 1, 2021</li> <li>July 2, 2021</li> <li>July 3, 2021</li> <li>July 04, 2021</li> <li>July 5, 2021</li> <li>July 12, 2021</li> <li>July 14,2021</li> <li>Jun 29, 2021</li> <li>June 30, 2021</li> <li>Leafy</li> <li>Leisure - Subbu One Offs #1</li> <li>Mainstream</li> <li>Much Ado About Nothing</li> <li>Ants</li> <li>Aug 05, 2021</li> <li>Bhagavad Gita As It Was</li> <li>Bildungsroman</li> <li>C'est La Vie</li> <li>Fan</li> <li>No One Can Write Just One Word</li> <li>On Cockroaches</li> <li>Random Thoughts</li> <li>Reduce the Scope but Stick to the Schedule</li> <li>Social Media Sucks - Part 1 of \u221e</li> <li>Splash</li> <li>Sunsets</li> <li>The Butler Did It</li> <li>The Impermanence of the Internet</li> <li>The Jhalmuriwaala</li> <li>The Non-Importance of Being Complex</li> <li>The Rule of 3</li> <li>The Xerox Shop of J.P.

This is not the permanent position of said plate. It has been placed there only temporarily and at the time was for the purposes of holding something that will be described in the very next para.</p> <p>The steel plate, last night, was filled with some quantity of water, perhaps to the 75% mark and squarely in the center of the circular plate sat a plastic container which housed, as of that moment, 2 Gulab Jamuns.</p> <p>It was 1 AM and I found myself at the crossroads of DecisionLand. On the one hand, there was the healthy, sane option of brushing my teeth, drinking a glass of warm water and going to bed at (what is now considered) a reasonably early hour. On the other, there was the far more tempting, but highly detridental option of tiptoeing to the kitchen and gorging on the gulab jamuns that had been procured earlier that evening. Why, you may ask, must an adult tiptoe in the comfort of his own home. But this is the vice of a habit developed by an individual who has been a minor for some years longer than he has been a legal adult.</p> <p>Anyway, I found myself in the kitchen with my hand on the plastic container before the results of thorough deliberation were out. And it is at this point that I noticed One ant. A lone warrior, clinging to the side of this container and if it had eyes that I could spot, possibly they would have been full of focus waiting for this precise moment when a human would come and unblock its way to what-it-had-no-doubt smelt its way to - sweet, divine ant-treasure. I wondered how it had made its way across the body of water in the plate but did not linger much on it. Meanwhile, evident that things had not gone the way the Warrior Ant had planned, it darted in the direction opposite the cover sensing perhaps that I had spotted it before the cover was opened. For good measure, I lifted the box out of the \"pool\" and decided to open it held in my hands, away from a place of familiarity to the Warrior, who had by now dropped into the water below. And it is at this point, that I noticed an extremely disturbing sight. Close to 20 more ants lay scattered in the water, some hidden from view by the box that was now in my hands, and some in plain sight that I had simply not seen. These were Warriors who had not made it to the Holy Jamun Land :O My mind at this time was racing with multiple thoughts, some for the Fallen Warriors, some about the box in my hand. What if the Warrior was just the last one who was about to enter the box and many had already succeeded and were now already partaking of its contents? What would I see when I opened the box?</p> <p>I stood in silence for a few seconds contemplating the possibilities. It was probably a lesser duration than I exaggerate at this point, but the thoughts were there. \"Let's assume that the worst has not happened\", I thought, \"and that this singular Warrior was the only one to make it. \". How did he (not necessarily, might have been a Wonder Womant as well, but for the purposes of this anecdote) make it? Had there been a plan of attack? Was this the leader of the troop? Had the army decided that it would be sufficient if one mant made it, for the greanter good? Was this the ant version of a heist? Did ants have heists? I'd learnt in the few minutes that I'd concentrated in my biology classes back in school that there was fierce collaboration in ant colonies, but was this a part of it?</p> <p>I moved closer to the platform and looked again at the fallen Warriors....Noble souls, one and all. They drifted there...unaware of their sacrifice's futility. I placed the box on the side and sadly emptied the contents of the plate into the sink. This was the order of Nature and I was a cold blooded ant disposer :( I refilled the contents of the plate with some more water than before, making the moat a little harder to wade than before ...My heart wept for the sacrifices to come as I thought about the next batch of Warrior Ants that would indulge in the pursuit of sweet fortunes..And my mind decided. No more.</p> <p>There would be no more mindless sacrifices. No more Ant drownings.</p> <p>Not on my watch.</p> <p>I opened the box and popped the last two Jamuns in my mouth.</p> <p>Time to brush and go to sleep.</p>"},{"location":"non-tech/mini-essays/aug-05-2021/","title":"Aug 05, 2021","text":"<p>There's this thing I need to get done by August 22.

Add to that, the convenience factor is unbeatable. Even the latest post, I just typed it up on my phone and posted. I pay around 3200 INR for the domain name and hosting per year.  </p> <p>The second most convenient is the Substack website. But I'm wary of it (Like I was with Medium) because it's new and I don't know if they might pivot to something else at some point. I'm using them cautiously but they're also ridiculously easy to post on. The block structure of usage and what formatting you can do on Substack is limited as compared to Wordpress but it works. It is fully free as of now because I haven't paid for a custom domain. I haven't even looked into what a paid plan offers.  </p> <p>The third most convenient is my Hugo website for BBB. Go gets easily installed and deploying the site once you've put in the initial work of choosing a theme is minimal.

There is a lot of discovery that's possible for your articles because of related \"Medium publishers\" picking up your writing based on the content, tags etc, but the reason I stopped using it is because I started seeing articles being put under a Premium paywall even when the content was sub-par. An elitist's garden that doesn't let most people smell the flowers. That didn't sit well with me and I've since migrated all my content to one of the above mentioned sites. But if you want to use it, that's up to you. It is convenient to publish on Medium akin to Substack.</p> <p>tl;dr -  If all you want is to pick up a place to write on and just ...write, Wordpress/Substack are your best options.

I gathered over the course of one circuit of the park that one of them was talking about a book that changed his life and the book had something to say about the power of the mind to fix the ailing body or some sort and the other guy had a sort of vicious vehement way about him, straightaway pooh-pooh-ing the whole notion.

He flew even higher and further for a few seconds as he reached the chimney of the restaurant at the end of the road, then he descended..softly landing at the base of what he saw was the arc of a three-dimensional rubber surface. \u201cThis is it\u201d, he thought, \u201cThis is how it all ends.\u201d.</p> <p>He had heard tales of these circular rubber beings trampling over his brethren ending their lives. They who were powerful as long as they stayed affixed to their host fathers, the Trees, were immediately at the mercy of every external agent, once disconnected. And he had heard of their merciless endings\u200a\u2014\u200acrushed, shredded, ripped up. Some got lucky, of course. They ended up in the warm confines of these mysterious, loved cages called \u201cbooks\u201d as\u2026\u201dbookermarks\u201d, he decided they were called. But he was wise beyond his years and he knew that even these safe-keepers were themselves descendants of his original caretakers, the Trees.</p> <p>As he lay there, breathing in heavily and feeling the heat Mr RubberArc near by was radiating silently, he thought of many things. He thought of how it had all come to this, as he knew was the norm. When the end was near, Leaves must think of how it all came to this. And so he thought\u2026.</p> <p>He thought of how even as a baby leaf, he was always the rebel, growing at the edge of Uncle Branch. All the other leaves were free to nestle up closer to Father Bark, but he would stand out\u200a\u2014\u200ablue instead of green like the rest, he\u2019d decided\u2026err..even though it had sort-of been decided for him. And he thought about how once the evil Mr. Monkien had jumped up and down on Uncle Branch and even threatened to harm him! But his life had not ended then as their friendly visitor Winden had blown Monkien away.</p> <p>But one incident stood out. It was when a huge metal blob had come out of nowhere and slammed squarely onto the torso of Father. And Father had let out a huge big roar of pain. But he had stood there and taken the brunt of the damage and save for Uncles Chip and Twig (may they wither in peace), the rest of the family was safe. Leafy would later learn that the metal blob was called a \u201cKaar\u201d and it was intoxicated with some sort of liquid called \u201cPetrol\u201d. Of course, all of these was alien to Leafy and he did not care about things that did not cause him harm. The only liquid (pfft, of course, he knew about liquids\u200a\u2014\u200aPaati Maramamma next door had yelled out the concepts to him and his siblings, when they were little. Sadly she had mysteriously reduced to a stump one day and Leafy\u2019s lessons had ended there.) he cared about was \u201cWater\u201d, a rejuvenating drink he drank everytime the skies above grew dark and Winden grew very,very loud.</p> <p>As he remembered these things, he was jerked to reality by the growing vibration of RubberArc and he muttered a silent goodbye to everyone, a goodbye he knew Winden would pass along. RubberArc was moving forward and suddenly came to a halt in sync with the shriek Leafy heard. Someone was moving swiftly towards him and before he knew it, he was being lifted and examined by a pair of glass panes\u2026.\u201dPapa! Look! A blue leaf!\u201d, the voice exclaimed. That was the last thing he heard before he passed out.</p> <p>When he awoke he felt a strange, calming warmth and a gentle rustle on the tip of his head.

This is, quite simply - Subbu Unplugged. Episode 1.</p> <p>\"All that is yours is rightfully mine... and mine it will be!\u201d. 10-year old Subbu\u2019s eyes widened in wonder as he gripped the joystick a little tighter and watched The Dark Prince whisper the next few lines and vanish into smoke\u2026so much smoke\u2026 the screen had gone black. He waited for a few more seconds before he realised the vanishing had more to do with an external agent than an internal actor. Amma stood by the side of the TV, the disconnected plug in her hand, an expression of impatience on her facing and one foot tapping on the ground with the rhythm of one who has been ignored for a while. \u201cAmma!\u201d, he protested, \u201cI was about to get to an important level!\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling you for the last ten minutes\u201d, Amma protested in retaliation and with a shriller voice that indicated the victor of this argument even before further sparring could ensue. \u201cDei! You have your exams in two weeks!\u201d, she continued, \u201cAnd you\u2019re sitting here playing this useless..this useless..\u201d. \u201cGame\u201d, Subbu completed, a look of resignation and decreasing annoyance on his face, even as he knew the end of the sentence was irrelevant.\u00a0</p> <p>He sighed, got up and went back to his room and picked up his Maths book, placed it on the bed and knelt on the floor, his elbows propped next to the book, a notebook on the side and an Apsara Black pencil in hand; if he was going to study, he might as well start with a subject \u00a0with the most syllabus to cover and get it over with. And that was the first paper anyway.</p> <p>\u201cIf Ramu\u2019s gardening plot is 10ft long and 5ft wide, and each\u00a0flower pot is 1m x 1m, how many flower pots can Ramu place across the plot\u2019s edges?\u201d, Subbu read out loudly. It seemed like quite the predicament Ramu was in and it reminded him of a problem his father had read to him from a story that featured a boy named Swamy. Swamy had been, to quote his father from the book,\u00a0\u201can extraordinary idiot\u201d. Subbu could hear Swamy\u2019s father\u2019s words in his own father\u2019s voice and scratched his head in puzzlement. He gave up and proceeded to read the next 20 problems from the page in the text (which were all along the same vein), none of which he felt his skills obtained at school had adequately prepared him for. He felt immense sympathy for Swamy and decided he had made a huge mistake in starting with Maths. It had reduced his morale \u00a0a lot. He needed a break to rejuvenate. If nothing else, surely, he\u2019d earned some leisure time for toiling this long? He tiptoed to the kitchen and teetered on his feet as he waited for Amma to turn around from chopping the vegetables. Once she seemed to have reached a logical conclusion, he nervously called out -\u00a0\u201cAmma\u2026I\u2019ve tried to solve twenty one problems\u201d, he chose his words carefully and gestured with open palms to indicate a measure beyond what his hands could show.\u00a0\u201cCan I continue my game for just five minutes?\u201d. Amma had heard this request before and she knew what five minutes meant. She sternly looked at him and said,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m sorry Subbu but the game will have to wait till the exams are over. You go to Pandi\u2019s house and see if he wants to play with you for 10-15 minutes.\u201d. Subbu groaned and shuffled out the kitchen but by the time he reached the hall, he'd accepted this free-time barter and ran out the house distractedly. Pandi and he were classmates and had also known each other ever since he had moved in.\u00a0</p> <p>\u201cPandiiiii\u201d, he went chanting even as he reached the 11 year old\u2019s house\u2019s gate. He noisily opened the gate with an air of familiarity and rapped on the door. The Ramakrishnan residence was very well acquainted with Subbu and had come to\u00a0regard him\u00a0a part of their family \u00a0- well, everyone except the baby of the house that always bit his hand as though indicating disapproval. He didn\u2019t have to wait long at the door. Pandi\u2019s mother, Mrs.Maami (as he knew her), opened the door with her ever-smiling face and greeted Subbu warmly ,\u00a0\u201cVaa da Subbu.. Padichutiya?\u201d (Come, come Subbu. Have you completed studying?). Subbu rolled his eyes but quickly said with every ounce of politeness he could muster ,\u00a0\u201cAaan aunty,\u00a0innum\u00a0konjam daan irruku\u201d (Yes aunty, only a little bit left to go). Was Pandi at home, he enquired. No, Pandi had\u00a0gone to his cousin\u2019s place to\u00a0\u201cgroup-study\u201d, he was informed. Maybe he should also go back home and continue studying, she suggested. Subbu frowned a little at this unexpected dashing of his plans to have fun and even more deeply at the suggestion that he ought to resume his preparations. Hmph. Didn\u2019t Maami aunty understand the importance of enjoyable activities? Nevertheless, he thanked Maami aunty and shuffled out, contemplating his next actions. His eyes fell on the parked cycle as he stepped into his gate and decided that would be a good act of leisure.\u00a0</p> <p>He took the cycle out and began his new act with renewed vigour, the previous disappointment forgotten. He pedalled despite the midday sun, passing the regular shops he visited with his dad, and the idle shopkeepers who were looking out on the streets hailed him, \u201cAy Subbu, enga da porai! Paarthu votu \u201d (Hey Subbu, where are you headed? Ride safely!), (those that recognised him anyway) and he yelled back \u00a0- \u201cHi uncle!\u201d,\u201d Hi aunty!\u201d. Everyone was \u201cuncle\u201d and \u201caunty\u201d as far as he was concerned. One of these greeters was Paramasivan uncle, the local florist. He went one step further than the rest of the shopkeepers and called Subbu into his store. Subbu\u2019s mother was a regular patron here, being quite the green thumb and Param uncle and she had become good friends (which meant discounts were given without being asked for). Subbu regularly accompanied her on her visits; needless to say, Paramasivan uncle had taken a shine to this charming youngster who stood by his mother patiently every time she chose seeds for what must be quite the forest by now and given him a lot of free methi seeds \"under the table\u201d in an attempt to inculcate the interest in the boy as well. Subbu wondered why he was being invited , maybe Amma had said she\u2019d collect something from him and he, Subbu was to be the conduit? Maybe. He went into the shop nevertheless and looked at Param uncle who was surveying the boy with a glint in his eyes. Then suddenly he said, \u201cSubbu! I haven\u2019t even shown your mum this, but I\u2019ve been working on a new project. Come!\u201d, he dashed to a backdoor and beckoned the boy into it. Subbu warily stepped in and gasped. It was a huge greenhouse with a whole bunch of pots with plants huddled at one side of the room. A small portion of the floor had been cordoned off by an array of red bricks.\u00a0</p> <p>\u201cSubbu\u201d, Param uncle called. Subbu felt a strange memory knocking at the back of his mind, even as he looked at all the pots at the corner of the room.\u00a0</p> <p>\u201cSubbu, I have this plot of land here 10ft by 5ft and I want to place pots all along the edges\u2026.\"</p>"},{"location":"non-tech/mini-essays/much-ado-about-nothing-1/","title":"Much ado about nothing -1","text":"<p>Anyone can tell a story if a day's been interesting.

And what gnaws on me day in and day out is the fact that this is all very dystopian and unnatural - the concept of assigning points to every little thing we say. every thought we have that we choose to put out there. This is not normal and definitely can't be healthy. We weigh things in real life in relative terms already. Now for years, we've started getting conditioned to weigh every statement we make as well, wanting each to perform better than the last.</p> <p>If Facebook was being shitty assigning multiple points to Emojis vs 1 for likes etc, Twitter is no better - the only difference is here we're in a pre-reactions world letting everyone else's judgement measure if Each thought of ours was \"Good\" or not, if it resonated with them enough to \"Retweet\" or not. And for some inexplicable reason, Retweets (that are not endorsements) have become extremely appealing to us, perhaps giving us reason to revel privately that somehow we are not alone in having this thought. This is obviously not leaving Instagram out by any means. Each photo we put out receives meaningless \"likes\" from friends and families who, for all we know, are double tapping out of nothing more than habit. And we know this.

The concept of attention-seeking isn't new. As Humans, it's almost primal that most of us seek attention for the things we do. It's how a baby starts off, receiving attention for the absolutely most mundane things he/she does - standing, walking, reading for the first time - all of which are praised heavily by the doting family, if we were lucky to have one. And we should count ourselves lucky for having it. Cut to school when we participate in events that make us \"stand out\" - extempores, debates, quizzes, races.

It had been a bumpy start to the day, what with his vehicle's engine seizing on the way to work and needing to be dropped off at the service center and his tripping on a loose brick on the pavement on his way home and landing face down with his palm attempting and failing to break his fall. He'd taken the day off, rested and on receiving a call from the service center a few hours later, decided he'd walk back and fetch his vehicle. Things were looking up now. And as he continued on his way, so did he. But the clear sky that had welcomed him out the door was now a shade of grey. He quickened his pace, but he could not outrun the clouds that seemingly instantaneously, growled and burst into lightning, thunder and a downpour that had seemed impossible just a few minutes ago. Raman was flat out running now. Had he paused to think, he might have taken shelter at a nearby shop or under a bus stand. But in his mind, all he wanted to do was reach the service center. So he ran, taking care to jump over puddles and loose stones, not wanting to trip a second time that day.</p> <p>In his urgency however, he didn't notice that he'd run off the pavement and was now running on the side of the road. Bikes and cars sped past him, just as eager to get to wherever they were going. After about a kilometer of running, he stopped and panted for breath. The weight of the wet clothes coupled with the stress of running left him gasping a little and he waited to regain his composure, still unmistakably getting drenched however. Just then a car, a blue sedan came speeding past him and mindless of the puddle next to him, splashed into and out of it, leaving an extremely brown pair of pants and shoes and an extremely angry wearer of said attire. He yelled pointlessly at the car that was long gone and then stopped, disappointment and rage lingering on his face. When he'd regained his composure, he wondered if he should just return home, change into some dry clothes and come back for the vehicle later. But he was almost there and he'd have to get drenched to go back anyway. Might as well power through and complete the mission at hand, he told himself and forged on. Soon he found himself at the mechanic's shop where a burly man and a young boy were hard at work, tightening screws and fixing things that probably never fixing. At the sight of this dripping, disheveled man, the owner immediately dropped his screwdriver and beckoned Raman to sit on the stool he'd just gotten off of. Looking at his state, he whispered something to the little boy and the latter ran off into a small room in the shop. It took the owner a few more seconds to recognize the customer that had dropped off his vehicle in the morning. He listened to Raman's day of woes, entries that had come pouring out the man with very little poking and meanwhile the little boy had returned, two hot cups of tea in his small hands that he offered both the men gingerly, but with a wide smile. It was only when the kid sat down on the floor next to him that Raman noticed the kid had a prosthetic leg. He looked at the mechanic, questioningly and was told about the accident at the shop a few years ago that had left the child maimed. They'd explored a few options before deciding the child needed to have a way to walk again and found a sympathetic doctor who had treated the child free of charge. The once ever-cheerful boy had spent months in pain and teary struggle, adapting to this new appendage. Raman listened to it all in silence, his eyes locked on the boy who had now resumed tightening a few smaller screws on a part of a vehicle, humming a tune from a familiar song.</p> <p>Once they'd finished drinking their hot beverages, the mechanic took Raman to his vehicle, showed him the estimate and gave him the sign off. Raman was only half listening now, his mind still on the cheerful disposition of the boy who had apparently gone through so much at such a young age and had somehow managed to find a way to smile despite it all.</p> <p>Before he left the shop, he shook the owner's hand and then went over to the boy and thanked him for the best tea he'd ever had. The boy gave him a glowing smile and Raman patted him on the head.</p> <p>As he rode back, the clouds having cleared up, he was still full of thoughts, a mixed bag of shame, pride, gratitude and contentment. The roads were still a mess though, he noted amid these thoughts, and slowed down as he saw an old man walking off the pavement by the side of the road and in the opposite direction.</p> <p>He gently rode into and out of the puddle directly next to the old man, taking care not to splash on him even a little.</p>","tags":["fiction"]},{"location":"non-tech/mini-essays/sunsets/","title":"Sunsets","text":"<p>He walked barefoot because the gravel felt like acupressure against his broken, aching soles.

And more often than not, they end up with acceptable, pleasant and sometimes even desirable results*. The most recent one was today, in getting a 600 page textbook printed** online but, forgetfully, not spiral bound as intended. So when the courier arrived with a cover enclosing a sheaf of 600 sheets, unbound and loose (but thankfully in order), I was puzzled and indignant, initially at the printers and then upon realization, at myself. The next 20 or so minutes were spent in wondering how best to collate the sheets.</p> <p>Many experiments were done - Stapling chapter 1 separately was attempted. I had overestimated the common stapler. Then I segregated each chapter and arranged the 12 chapters in a neat row and congratulated myself on how good the arrangement looked. I briefly considered reading the book page by page. This idea was quickly dismissed. I also considered tagging them but maintaining a tagged set of 100-120 pages at a time is quite a chore as evidenced by past experiences. Finally I decided I'd undo my initial mistake and get the book spiral bound from a shop nearby. It would come at a price perhaps greater than I would have got it at if I'd remembered to do it the first time but oh well. It was the only way, I reasoned.</p> <p>As I got ready to assemble the neat set of sheets, I wondered if I really wanted a bulky spiral bound book to carry around everytime I was reading a chapter or worse, a couple of pages. No. God had wanted me to make this mistake so I would have a choice, after looking at the number of sheets, of a combination of chapters to spiral bind per my liking. And when the Divine interfere in man-made plans, who are we to disagree? I decided I'd get the book spiral bound , two chapters per mini-book - 6 mini-books in total.</p> <p>This new arrangement with intermediate separators for chapter-markers in place, I went to the Xerox shop. Now, bear in mind that I'm already hoping to reduce my overall cost to minimize my initial errors, so I'd decided to get the best deal for this additional-cost-incurring spiral binding. I approached the man at the counter and assumed a tone of what I hoped was familiarity - \"Hello!! Isn't your owner around?\", I asked placing my Queen's pawn two steps forward (1.e5), the opening move of every chess player around the globe. My opponent showed no sense of expected affability, an individual obviously very used to dealing with potential bargainers. \"Gone out. Tell me\", he parried (1.d5 ). My chance at an early advantage lost, I decided the only way forward was friendly aggression. \"Heh, I'd like these pages spiral bound.\", and without leaving a gap for a dialogue, I continued - \"I come here all the time. How much will you charge for these?\". The man scratched his forehead - \"If you come here all the time, don't you know how much a spiral bind costs?\", he sniggered, as if to say - \"Dei, if you are bad, I am your dad\". He had me stumped, I admit. But not one to give up, fueled by skills gained over years of cheapness, I said, \"Hehe, I meant, I used to come here all the time. Studied right here\", I thumbed at the school behind me. Never mind the fact that this shop hadn't existed at the time I studied there, but he wouldn't know. He seemed satisfied. His tone turned genial - \"Saar 30 rupees per copy. 180 kodi\". I recognized the shift in tone but I still felt entitled for an enhanced discount. Not my best moment. \"150 madkoli\". There was some friendly heheh-ing, a promise of future sales and referrals on my part, some head shaking and eventual hesitant nodding on his and he began the task at hand. \"Mission: Bargaining - Accomplished\", I rejoiced.</p> <p>And I waited. And watched.</p> <p>The man separated the sheets I'd placed in order of chapters (thanks to my markers) and deftly took out a few sheets at a time and ran them through a punching machine before setting them aside. He repeated this task over and over untiring and with an air of someone who'd done this hundreds of times. A master at work. As I saw him run the punch through the sheets, I noticed the work it took. Even though he seemed to do it effortlessly, there was obviously some energy being expended with every downward motion. When someone skillful is at work, the sight of it is beautiful. Like a potter with his hands shaping a pot out of what was just minutes ago, mud. Like a carpenter slicing through wood as if it were butter. Like a man at a Xerox shop spiralling a coil of plastic through a vertical array of newly created holes as if it were just a nut around a bolt.</p> <p>In less than twenty minutes, he placed the 6 mini-books in front of me and said - \"Done saar.\". I gave him 200 rupees, waved to say I didn't want the change and mouthed \"Thank you\".

But this article aims to address those who write long form text in order to inform or educate or entertain - either by way of journalistic reports, enthusiastic essays or even casual book or movie reviews.</p> <p>Both the segments have something to sell - some form of an idea, translated into its end forms. But the latter segment, I've found, needs more persistence if they are to be successful in their endeavor. We've all heard of \"Writer's block\", that excuse most authors offer up as an excuse to explain their laziness and/or procrastination. And there are a lot of articles on how to overcome this (imaginary) affliction. But relatively less is spoken about how writers end their works. There are some, of course, but the phenomenon is experienced more than it is spoken about. Let's assume therefore that the writer; a writer, is all gung-ho about what he's writing and has a solid start and an idea in place; a solid premise with which to begin his work. And he continues putting on paper, so to speak, the words that are taking shape in his mind as he takes context into account of what he has already written. And at some point, when the facts have been laid out and he has said what he has had to say, the crux of the idea, atleast, he pauses. He hasn't really thought this through. He scratches his head and looks around for inspiration. Maybe some object in his surrounding can be incorporated in his work that will bring him closer to a conclusion. He retraces his steps and reads what he's already written. Did he miss some logical threads? Did he jump the gun at some point to an unobvious inference? He hasn't. In the meantime he's received a ping on his cellphone that prompts him to check on a tweet he's posted earlier in the day. It's a response cheering him on. He's boasted promisingly about how he means to write something concrete by the end of the day. He guiltily slinks back to the minimized document and rests his hand on the keyboard, by now having forgotten where his thoughts wandered off and he rereads the last line. He tries thinking about the original premise again. Should he add an alternate angle to the pot? Will this help him round off the whole thing nicely by stating that all perspectives having been looked at, this is the logical end of the topic in question? Perhaps. He thinks about all the authors he's read. How did they conclude their works? The last arrow in his quiver - imitation. But even drawing inspiration from that seems laborious. His eyes droop. He yawns. He's exhausted..his brain cells are slowly shutting down, having thought so much about something that should, ideally, not be so tough to do now that he's managed to convey his original idea pretty cogently. But, as easy as it should be, the end is, in fact, a very important part of the article. But the writer is tired and he makes up a lazy half-assed conclusion and hits \"Publish\". He's victorious. He has completed his work, hasn't he? He's too tired to feel guilty, to acknowledge the gnawing voice in his head that's telling him he hasn't done complete justice to what he set out to do.</p> <p>Another important parameter in this discussion and one that's even more relevant today than it has ever been is distraction. Humans today have shockingly low attention spans, fueled by smartphones and the Internet and false measures of satisfaction received from hits of dopamine from social networking sites that they think they've made contributions to by way of one-line statuses and \"microblog\" entries. Likes and Reactions and Hearts do nothing to disabuse us of our misguided notions. These excuse for ideas are fleeting and are wasted on the transient content hoarders. Their only purpose is to give us those bursts of \"happiness\" and are not of any value when ideas have to germinate and grow in our minds. And while there are many thinkers and doers on these websites that do offer up tons of free advice and thoughts that poke and tickle our minds, these effects are again, impermanent and do not leave any lasting traces to better us as individuals. Let's say you do draw some value. It's still minuscule compared to what you're losing out on in the process. This is a massive reason for Writer's Fatigue.</p> <p>Paraphrasing a quote that has dated well from when it was originally made, I believe in 1867, \"Don't judge a book by its cover\",most people are told. Maybe they're friends of this writer. Maybe the journal that's published his work has some faith in his past works and this article has therefore passed muster. And so, the first network that this writer can reach reads the article. The fact that it starts off strong dripping and showcasing the pinnacle of his enthusiasm is very good. But if, by the time, the reader reaches the end of the article and is not offered the requisite satisfaction, or if his interest has somehow dwindled by the 60 or 70% mark, the writer has quite unambiguously failed in his efforts. He has transferred the idea he wished to convey to the reader, sure. But the idea will not linger. Because it is now clouded with this air of dissatisfaction. If, even by chance, conversations are struck up about this piece of work, it will always have words synonymous with \"okay\" or \"alright\" attached to it. And the secondhand narrative will not come off as persuasive as it could have been. A whole second network of readers deprived of an idea all because of the writer's fatigue; his failure to end his article with the same interest he had started his article with. And this is the damage that \"writer's fatigue\" can do.</p> <p>Is there a solution to this? Is there a way a writer can power ahead and give an article the kind of conclusion it deserves? Will a reader be rewarded for the time he has invested in the article all the way to the bottom of the page?</p> <p>One of the most obvious solutions is to take a page out of Stephen Covey's book. He famously remarked - \"Begin with the End in Mind\". Easier said than done, yes. But it always helps if you sit and think about the entire draft and not just the meat of the matter, before putting pen to paper.</p> <p>Another step in the right direction would be to deprive one's self of all distractions while writing so as to not interrupt the flow of thoughts. In the dozen short stories I've written so far, only a couple of them have had satisfying endings, if I say so myself, because they've been written with some amount of intense focus, and it shows. The irony that this very post will be shared on the vile aforementioned social networking websites is not lost on me. But I have tried to prevent myself in their usage while working on this post. Attempting to walk the talk, as it were.</p> <p>If the subject has a conclusion of its own - like the end of a movie or the last page of a book, that's easier to see as a logical end, but even that shouldn't be jumped to just because you're tired of writing. Because, as I've already said, a skydiving experience is only blissful, if your parachute opens up and you land safely, gracefully. The alternative is a plunge that no one recovers from. Abstract subjects are less easy to end, but for these, a scope of discussion must be established.</p> <p>Of course, these aren't silver bullets and you are ultimately at the mercy of the subject of what you're writing about, the amount of practice you've had and your own mind. I'm learning how to overcome it consistently myself. But I hope this atleast helps address the issue if not resolve it.</p> <p>Maybe this isn't a satisfying end to this article either.</p> <p>Maybe it is.</p> <p>What do you think? Have you faced Writer's Fatigue? If yes, what's your way of tackling it?</p>"},{"location":"non-tech/mini-essays/writing-prompt-1/","title":"Writing Prompt #1","text":"","tags":["work-in-progress"]},{"location":"non-tech/mini-essays/writing-prompt-1/#wp-you-live-in-a-martial-art-anime-universe-where-the-characters-announce-their-moves-before-executing-them-as-a-deaf-character-you-announce-with-sign-language-which-leads-to-resentment-among-your-defeated-opponents-of-your-underhanded-sneak-attacks","title":"[WP] You live in a martial art anime universe where the characters announce their moves before executing them.

It feels like everytime I win, I sink a little lower into a hole labelled with my initials, a hole I realised I was born in when I figured out that the silence I experienced perpetually was exclusive to me in my family of 10.</p> <p>My mother, for her part, never made me feel any different. She'd started training me as soon as I was old enough to crawl (she said). Our system of education was unique. We were educated not in Maths or Science as the rest of the World was, but in the form of Kudo. Kudo was the martial arts technique handed down to us by generations of Japanese warriors before us. Our ancestors prided themselves on the art of \"lightness\". The best Kudo practitioners were those who knocked down their opponents with the simplest of moves and with seemingly, no contact at all - for example, an expert Kudo move would be a light, but rapid sweep of the foot an inch away from the opponent and the net effect on an amateur opponent would be the equivalent of a blast of wind to the torso blowing him away. Such masters of the technique were awarded the Jupiter belt. But my world of silence helped me concentrate and when I was practicing Kudo, I was in a zone of complete focus. Consequently, at age 7, I was the youngest recipient of the Jupiter Belt.</p> <p>I shook out of my reverie and looked around at the near-empty, dilapidated dojo. It had been 3 years since the award ceremony to today - the day of the tournament. A giant board hung limply at a corner, but the LED lights declared the next and final round in a bright and bold fashion - \"Sushima vs Tenma\".</p> <p>The road so far had not been easy. Not from a fighting perspective of course; I\u00a0was\u00a0better than most of the fighters here, but it always seemed like I was skirting a line - a line that all that stood between \"Winner\" and \"Disqualified\". It didn't help that my opponents in most of the prior matches kept declaring that they couldn't understand the moves I was signalling to them - and what else could I do? I could try speaking it out and they Still wouldn't understand it any better because of my ineptitude in the vocal department! And it wasn't as if\u00a0they\u00a0were being fair to me! I was interpreting their voiced pre-actions via lip movements! That put\u00a0me\u00a0at a disadvantage as well! Didn't they ever consider that? Of course not. \"The hubris of the defeated\".

So what makes superhero movies so special? What makes Superheroes special? There is definitely a faction out there that will say \u201cNothing\u201d, but the vast majority of us, superheroes are a symbol of hope and wonder, the fact that acts are being done by individuals that the rest of us can only\u2026marvel..over. For all the hypocritical beings that we are, we still yearn for personal justice and superheroes seem to provide us that.</p> <p>For the past 11 years, over 22 movies, the MCU has been giving us just that, perhaps not meeting expectations every time but always leaving us with something to talk about and the characters themselves to visualise as perfect images in our own minds, either in agreement or in criticism of their works.</p> <p>This movie, Avengers : End Game, is special in that sense, if not for anything else (even though it IS for more reasons) . It marks the end of an era and in an extremely satisfying way. Iron Man both, as a character and as the first movie that started this train off in 2008, has been one of my absolute favourites partly because of our shared affinity to everything tech. Add to that Robert Downey Jr\u2019s charisma and his chemistry with the (again) perfectly-cast Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and you get one brilliant character. Every scene that they\u2019ve been in since then has been my favourite throughout the years and this movie is no exception.</p> <p>The mind works in mysterious ways and we as humans have evolved over time to embrace cliffhangers very well - Chris Nolan has left no dearth of training us to accept those as brilliant ends for movies. But what the mind also desires, and subjectively, is happier obtaining, on a parallel vein, is Closure. And Endgame gives us that. When the movie ended after 3 hours, a duration that is long on its face but seemed to fly away in this context, I remember feeling exactly how I\u2019d felt when Logan ended. Like there was a knot in my chest that didn\u2019t seem to want to untie itself.</p> <p>I'm not going to tell you anything specific about the movie. If you've been a fan of the franchise, you'll watch it and you'll form opinions about it. But I really hope you love it\u00a0:)</p> <p>And I guess it\u2019s okay that it's over. You know? Part of the journey Is the end, after all.</p> <p>And if nothing else, we will always have Blu-Ray discs to watch and relive it all again.</p>"},{"location":"non-tech/movies/unbreakable/","title":"Unbreakable","text":"<p>I don't watch many movies at home because I lack the patience and 20 minute \"A Bit of Fry and Laurie\" episodes are so much more fun.

It's the first time I've seen Bruce Willis in a non-John McClane role and I am impressed. He's his characteristic tough-guy self with very few emotions on his face, maybe a hint of a smile once in a while, but it worked.

While I wasn't very active on social media to know much of the details around the movie (and not knowing particularly One of the details made it so much more enjoyable a watch for me). People had told me one thing though - that Kaithi, also directed by Lokesh had something to do with Vikram, so it was fortuitous that I had only watched it recently and the details were still fresh in my mind.</p> <p>So, at 6 PM on Saturday, I reached Urvashi theater and took my seat to face an already dancing Kamal Hassan in his \"Patthala Patthala\" song. The movie took a few minutes to start making sense for me and it's only when Fahad Faasil appeared on screen that things really began to take shape. FF and his group of government-appointed-nameless-spies were to unveil the identities of a masked group of \"terrorists\". FF's character has had a history of successful operations to his name and that's why his team was chosen for this job as well. And we soon see why. The action scenes are brilliantly shot with nothing being thrown in for mere effect or generously. The details that you will see flying all over the internet now are woven beautifully through the movie and some of them you only spot retrospectively. The movie was brilliant for multiple reasons, not the least of which was Anirudh's music in all his songs - the Vikram theme, the \"Once upon a time, there was a Ghost\" song and pretty much throughout the movie. This is a man who knows his craft inside and out.</p> <p>Towards the 70% mark, there are some characters important to the overall plot are given a few minutes of importance but those minutes are worth a lot of importance and the audience roared for all the right reasons.</p> <p>Apart from the mini-special characters, there were multiple film stars - Kamal, Vijay Sethupathi, Arjun Das, FaFa etc in the movie but all of them get just the right amount of screen space. And that brings me to what I thankfully didn't know because of my absence of attentiveness on social media - the identity of the druglord whose name is uttered multiple times in the movie but is revealed only towards the end - Who is the infamous Rolex?</p> <p>One of the last scenes is also how you understand the relevance of Kaithi to Vikam.</p> <p>Overall time well spent.
