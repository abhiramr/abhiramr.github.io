3 Blue 1 Brown is an amazing Youtube resource to learn Math and Physics concepts from!
Manim is an opensource package created by them to help generate the animations they use to teach these concepts. In this article, I will create a similar video with the help of Claude and Manim!



- First, install [miktex](https://miktex.org/download)
- Then, in powershell, install [ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) :  run `choco install ffmpeg`
- Create a new virtual environment and install manim and manimgl - `uv pip install manim manimgl`
- Use Claude to generate a manim program for a formula or something you want to demonstrate -  E.g. : [My Claude Example](https://claude.ai/share/4e8601c7-c2b1-42b6-95e0-52059378902f)
- Create a program that you got out of claude - [Manim Program for x-squared](https://claude.site/artifacts/fdfb2ed3-efcb-45df-b459-e0a32c5571a3)
- Execute it -  `manim -pql xsquared.py ExplainXSquared`

This results in this beautiful 3 Blue 1 Brown like video! -
