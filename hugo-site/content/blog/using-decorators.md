In Python, a decorator is a way to modify or extend the behavior of a function or class without changing its source code. Decorators are a powerful tool for adding functionality to existing code, and they are especially useful when you want to apply the same behavior to multiple functions or classes.

### How Decorators Work
In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions. This makes it possible to define a decorator function that takes another function as an argument, modifies its behavior in some way, and then returns the modified function.

Here's an example of a simple decorator that adds logging to a function:

```python
def log_function(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Called {func.__name__} with args {args} and kwargs {kwargs}. Result: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

@log_function
def my_function(x, y):
    return x + y
```

In this example, log_function is a decorator that takes a function as an argument and returns a new function that logs the arguments and result of the original function. The `@log_function` syntax is a shorthand way of applying the decorator to the my_function function.

### Using Decorators with Classes
Decorators can also be used with classes in Python. Here's an example of a decorator that adds logging to a class method:

```python
def log_method(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Called {func.__name__} with args {args} and kwargs {kwargs}. Result: {result}")
        return result
    return wrapper

class MyClass:
    @log_method
    def my_method(self, x, y):
        return x + y
```

In this example, `log_method` is a decorator that takes a method as an argument and returns a new method that logs the arguments and result of the original method. The `@log_method` syntax is a shorthand way of applying the decorator to the my_method method.
