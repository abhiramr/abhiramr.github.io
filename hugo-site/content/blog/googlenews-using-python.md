*This article is part of something I'm building up to* 

I wanted to find a way in which I can get news off of Google News programatically and something that doesn't need to me be authenticated for it. I wondered if I should build a scraper for it, but thankfully, there's a Python package already that does it  - [GoogleNews on Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/GoogleNews/)

I installed it in a new [`uv` virtual environment](https://everythingpython.substack.com/p/virtual-environments-using-uv) using `pip install googlenews` and it was pretty easy to use . 

For example, if I want to fetch the news for the last 1 day for Bangalore - 

```python
>>> from GoogleNews import GoogleNews
>>> googlenews = GoogleNews(period='1d')
>>> googlenews.get_news('Bangalore')
>>>for i in googlenews.results()[:10]:
       print(i["title"])
```

This prints (as of today, the 22nd) the news for yesterday, the 21st of Nov -

And as we can see from Google News, this is decently accurate!

If a new topic is desired, we must first run `googlenews.clear()` to flush the earlier records. 

For example, if I now want to fetch the latest news about GenAI, I'll execute -

```python
>>> googlenews.clear()
>>> googlenews.get_news('Gen AI')
>>> for i in googlenews.results()[:10]:
...     print(f'- {i["title"]}')
```

Which gives me -
