<p>It's been a long time coming but I finally got around to starting with the Asterix comics! Asterix the Gaul was hilarious - a classic tale of outwitting the enemy army with sheer cunning (and a little bit of magic, of course), I couldn't help but draw parallels with the grim story of Iron Man and how he escaped his own captors with the help of Ho Yinsen, the scientist to Asterix's Getafix. Except with more than a shade of humor.<p>

<p>Looking forward to rest of the series.</p>
