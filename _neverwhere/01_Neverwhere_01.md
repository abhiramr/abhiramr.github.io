I think this project will only get done if I commit to it and start tracking my progress in some tangible manner. This blog seems like a good enough candidate. 

#### Current Status

Date : 11 Jun 2018. 
I've made a crappy Django site so far that takes in the Book name, its author's name and its genre. This status is as of many days ago - a time when I did not know Django to the extent that I know now. 

<p> Onward.</p>


### To-Do : 

- Draw object diagram and architecture diagram and make the first cut.
- Soft deadline set for self : 15th Jun 2018
