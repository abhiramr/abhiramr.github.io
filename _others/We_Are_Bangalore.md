Hey guys,
Thank you for being an awesome bunch of peeps participating on the threads and sharing your hobbies and ideas and favorite parks and everything else really. :blush: I certainly had a lot of fun learning everything I did. 
Now, I'm a data engineer and I'm not in favor of losing out on information that's provided because it's invaluable :)

So I thought I'd make a ready reckoner for the threads so you can look it up here anytime! :)

<h2><u> Favorite parks -</u></h2>

<h2><u> Life near a Metro -</u></h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[Thread] The Metro in Bangalore is slowly but surely becoming a very reliable mode of transportation in the city(atleast to the stations it connects so far). But it&#39;s really not accessible if you forget your wallet &amp; therefore can&#39;t buy a ticket even if you have PayTM/Phonepe etc</p>&mdash; Bengaluru/Abhiram (@WeAreBangalore) <a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreBangalore/status/1145705148536127489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2><u>Readers of Bangalore - </u></h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[Today&#39;s Thread] I love reading. And I especially like books that are part of a series.
