<p>
    I'm a programmer from Bangalore, India and I like coding, reading and writing. I run <a href="https://brokebibliophilesbangalore.com">Broke Bibliophiles Bangalore</a>, a reading community in Bangalore and write short stories, among other things at <a href="abhiwrites.com">abhiwrites.com</a>.
</p>

<p> I'm interested in Python/Web development projects, freelance writing and anything related to books/humor/cartoons/anime. If you'd like to talk, <a href="mailto:abhi.darkness.com">mail me</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/abhi5459">DM me on Twitter.</a></p>
