<h1 style="color:black">Hi. I'm Abhiram</h1>
<p>
    I like coding, reading and writing. I co-created and run <b><a href="https://brokebibliophilesbangalore.com/about/">Broke Bibliophiles Bangalore</a></b>, a reading community in Bangalore and write short stories, among other things at <b><a href="https://abhiwrites.com">abhiwrites.com</a></b>.
</p>

<p> My areas of interest involve creating narratives and visualizations from data using Python/R, Data Engineering and Analysis (ETL/Databases) - pretty much anything related to data, books or wordplay. If you'd like to talk,<b> <a href="mailto:abhi.darkness.com">mail me</a> </b> or <b><a href="https://twitter.com/abhicantdraw">DM me on Twitter.</a></b></p>
